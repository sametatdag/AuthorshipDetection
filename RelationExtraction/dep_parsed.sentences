The RING finger mutant form of PROTX2 showed a threefold - lower interaction with PROTX1 in the yeast system ,  and deletion of the N - terminal RING finger domain of PROTX2 abolished the interaction.|||0
Consistent with the IFA results ,  a mutant PROTX1 protein that lacks the C - terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PROTX2 in the yeast system.|||0
Therefore ,  we suggest that a direct interaction between PROTX1 and the N - terminal RING finger domain of PROTX2 may inhibit oligomerization and protein - protein complex formation by PROTX2 ,  leading to displacement of PROTX2 and PROTX1 from the PODs ,  and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PROTX2.|||0
Specifically ,  it was shown that an amino - terminal segment of PROTX1 (aa.13 - 25 )  contains the information necessary for binding to PROTX2 isoforms 1 - 3 ,  but not to the isoform 4 ,  suggesting that the interacting domain is located immediately upstream from the Armadillo repeats and is encoded by exons 5 and 6 ,  which are subject to alternative splicing only in a minority of transcripts.|||0

A 50% inhibition of in vitro NER occurred at a 50:1 molar ratio of PROTX1 C - terminus fragment to PROTX2 monomer.|||0
It also appears that preassembly of PROTX2 at repair sites mitigates the inhibitory effect of PROTX1.|||0
We further demonstrate that the inhibition of DNA repair is mediated via binding of PROTX1 to PROTX2.|||0

All samples with at least 2 altered loci exhibited methylation of the PROTX1 promoter region, but none had detectable mutations in PROTX1 or PROTX2.|||0

To better define these roles, we have used two previously characterized lines of genetically altered mice: estrogen receptor - alpha (PROTX1) knockout (ERKO) mice, which lack the gene encoding PROTX1, and mouse mammary virus tumor (MMTV) - PROTX2 transgenic mice (PROTX2 TG), which develop mammary hyperplasia and neoplasia due to ectopic production of the PROTX2 secretory glycoprotein.|||0
We have crossed these lines to ascertain the effects of PROTX1 deficiency on mammary gland development and carcinogenesis in mice expressing the PROTX2 transgene.|||0
Introduction of the PROTX2 transgene into the ERKO background stimulates proliferation of alveolar - like epithelium, indicating that PROTX2 protein can promote mitogenesis in the absence of an PROTX1 - mediated response.|||0
The hyperplastic glandular tissue remains confined to the nipple region, implying that the requirement for PROTX1 in ductal expansion is not overcome by ectopic PROTX2.|||0
Tumors were detected in virgin ERKO females expressing the PROTX2 transgene at an average age (48 weeks) that is twice that seen in virgin PROTX2 TG mice (24 weeks) competent to produce PROTX1.|||0
Small hyperplastic mammary glands were observed in PROTX2 TG males, regardless of PROTX1 gene status; the glands were similar in appearance to those found in ERKO / PROTX2 TG females.|||0
Mammary tumors also occurred in PROTX2 TG males; latency tended to be longer in the heterozygous PROTX1 and ERKO males (86 to 100 weeks) than in wild - type PROTX1 mice (ca. 75 weeks).|||0
We conclude that ectopic expression of the PROTX2 proto - oncogene can induce mammary hyperplasia and tumorigenesis in the absence of PROTX1 in female and male mice.|||0

This propensity was also confirmed in LAN - 5 human neuroblastoma cells, where phosphorylation of the PROTX2 C - terminal domain and expression of PROTX1 also decreased remarkably in the late neural differentiation stages.|||0
This interaction apparently does not require the integrity of the PROTX1 complex, as it was found to occur with extracts from cells deficient in the PROTX2, one of the components of the PROTX1 complex.|||0

Here, we used pulse - chase analysis to show that the in vivo loss of PROTX1 protein in PROTX2 - immortalized MECs is a consequence of enhanced degradation.|||0
Treatment of PROTX2 - immortalized MECs with aldehyde inhibitors of proteasome - associated proteases led to a marked stabilization of PROTX1 protein, particularly the hypophosphorylated form.|||0
We have previously determined the structure of the chromo domain from the mouse PROTX1 protein, PROTX2.|||0

However, the dimerization domains of PROTX1 and PROTX2 did not interact, suggesting that these proteins exist predominantly as homodimers.|||0
While having similar telomere binding activity and domain organization, PROTX2 differed from PROTX1 in that its N terminus was basic rather than acidic, and PROTX2 was much more conserved than PROTX1.|||1
Because PROTX1 and PROTX2 showed significant differences, we suggest that these factors have distinct functions at telomeres.|||0

Autophosphorylation of PROTX1 overcomes this inhibition by inducing conformational changes in PROTX0 ,  thereby exposing a region in PROTX2 for possible TAR binding.|||0
This inhibition is relieved by the binding of the C - terminal region of PROTX1 to the transcription elongation factor PROTX2 -  PROTX0 and perhaps other cellular factors.|||0
Upon release from the intramolecular interaction ,  the C - terminal region also interacts with PROTX0 and is required for HIV - 1 transcription ,  suggesting its role in bridging the PROTX1 -  PROTX2 - TAR complex and the basal elongation apparatus.|||0

PROTX1 binds to PROTX2 and stimulates its nuclease activity ,  but the physiological significance of this interaction is unknown.|||1
In a reconstituted BER assay system containing PROTX2 ,  omission of PROTX1 caused the accumulation of pre - excision reaction intermediates which could be converted to completely repaired product by addition of PROTX1.|||0

We find that DNA replication and ultraviolet - induced DNA repair synthesis in permeable human fibroblasts are also more sensitive to inhibition by ddTTP than PROTX1 and less sensitive than PROTX2.|||0
These are both much less than the Ki of PROTX1 (which is greater than 200 microM) but greater than the Ki of PROTX2 (which is less than 2 microM).|||0
In permeable cells, the process was further analyzed by using the nucleotide analogue (butylphenyl) - 2' - deoxyguanosine 5' - triphosphate, which inhibits PROTX1 several hundred times more strongly than it inhibits PROTX2.|||0

In order to shed some light on this issue, we analysed the localisation of two proteins that are involved in early steps of meiotic recombination, PROTX1 and PROTX2, relative to AEs and SCs by immunofluorescence labelling of paraffin sections of the mouse testis, using affinity -  purified polyclonal antibodies against PROTX1 and PROTX2, and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SC components.|||0
The localisation patterns of PROTX2 and PROTX1 within spermatocytes were very similar.|||0
PROTX2 and PROTX1 appeared in high abundance in preleptotene spermatocytes, just before SC components could be detected.|||0
In mid and late zygotene, PROTX2 and PROTX1 concentrated in distinct areas; in early pachytene the two proteins had almost disappeared from the nucleus, except from the sex vesicle (the chromatin of the XY bivalent), where they persisted in high abundance until diplotene.|||0
We propose that PROTX2 and PROTX1, together with other proteins, prepare chromatin throughout the early meiotic prophase nucleus for the initiation of meiotic recombination.|||0
Possibly, only a small fraction of the PROTX1 -  and PROTX2 - containing (pre)recombination complexes associates transiently with AEs, where further steps in meiotic recombination can take place.|||0
