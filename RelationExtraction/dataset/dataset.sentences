Since recently PROTX1 has been shown to promote the GDP / GTP exchange activity of the cytoskeleton signaling molecule small GTPase PROTX2 and activates its downstream signaling ,  our present findings raise the possibility of involvement of the small GTPase in IFN signaling leading to its biological effects ,  including cytoskeleton reorganization.
Since ,  PROTX2 and PROTX1 are often co - expressed with other PROTX0 family of cdk inhibitors during the induction of cellular differentiation and are synergistic in their effect ,  a deregulation of their coordinate expression may underlie the lack of complete differentiation in medulloblastoma.

A functional analysis of the PROTX1 promoter showed that a GC - rich region located between positions  - 83 and  - 74 ,  which contains a PROTX2 - responsive element and one PROTX0  -  binding site ,  is sufficient for the upregulation of PROTX0 promoter by GGTI - 298.

The dominant negative mutant of PROTX0 ,  but not PROTX2 ,  was able to activate PROTX1.
In contrast ,  constitutively active PROTX2 repressed PROTX1.
Accordingly ,  the PROTX1 ,  which specifically inhibits PROTX0 proteins ,  enhanced the activity of PROTX2.
Accordingly ,  the PROTX1 ,  which specifically inhibits PROTX2 proteins ,  enhanced the activity of PROTX0.
Taken together ,  these results suggest that one mechanism by which GGTI - 298 upregulates PROTX2 transcription is by preventing the small GTPase PROTX1 from repressing PROTX2 induction.
Using a yeast two - hybrid screen with PROTX1 as the bait ,  we have identified the transcription factor PROTX2 as a direct PROTX1 - interacting partner.
The PROTX1 -  PROTX2 interaction was confirmed in vitro and in vivo.
PROTX1 repressed transcriptional activation mediated by PROTX2 fused to the PROTX0 DNA - binding domain from a PROTX0 responsive reporter ,  or by PROTX2 from an PROTX0 - responsive reporter.
Several naturally occurring and clustered PROTX0 missense mutations disrupted PROTX1 interaction with PROTX2.
These observations suggest that PROTX1's tumor suppressor function involves direct binding to PROTX2 and inhibition of PROTX2 activated transcription.
Using a mammalian two - hybrid assay ,  we further demonstrated that PROTX2 deletions lacking repression activity fused to the PROTX0 transactivation domain strongly activated transcription when coexpressed with PROTX1.
Earlier we have shown (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA; 95: 6977 - 6982 ,  1998 )  that silicon phthalocyanine (Pc4 )  - PDT results in an induction of the cyclin kinase inhibitor PROTX1 which ,  by inhibiting cyclins (E and D1 )  and cyclin dependent kinases ( PROTX2 and PROTX0 )  ,  results in a G0 / G1 - phase arrest followed by apoptosis in human epidermoid carcinoma cells A431.

Indeed ,  a specific interaction between PROTX1 and PROTX2 was observed in a yeast two - hybrid assay ,  and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of PROTX0 with the PROTX0.
Indeed ,  a specific interaction between PROTX0 and PROTX0 was observed in a yeast two - hybrid assay ,  and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of PROTX1 with the PROTX2.
The RING finger mutant form of PROTX2 showed a threefold - lower interaction with PROTX1 in the yeast system ,  and deletion of the N - terminal RING finger domain of PROTX2 abolished the interaction.
Consistent with the IFA results ,  a mutant PROTX1 protein that lacks the C - terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PROTX2 in the yeast system.
Therefore ,  we suggest that a direct interaction between PROTX1 and the N - terminal RING finger domain of PROTX2 may inhibit oligomerization and protein - protein complex formation by PROTX2 ,  leading to displacement of PROTX2 and PROTX1 from the PODs ,  and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PROTX2.
Specifically ,  it was shown that an amino - terminal segment of PROTX1 (aa.13 - 25 )  contains the information necessary for binding to PROTX2 isoforms 1 - 3 ,  but not to the isoform 4 ,  suggesting that the interacting domain is located immediately upstream from the Armadillo repeats and is encoded by exons 5 and 6 ,  which are subject to alternative splicing only in a minority of transcripts.
Finally ,  the tissue - specific expression of PROTX1 was shown to partially overlap with that of PROTX2 ,  suggesting that the interaction of these two proteins may contribute to the modulation of cell - cell / matrix interactions in such tissues.
Although the two - hybrid system was not able to verify a direct interaction between the PROTX1 NC1 domain and the short arm of PROTX2 ,  the PROTX1 NC1 domain (tVII / NC1 )  and the PROTX0 chain globular domain VI ( PROTX0 )  cDNAs ,  when used as baits ,  detected four overlapping cDNA clones encoding PROTX0 1 ( PROTX0 ) .

The PROTX1 NC1 /  PROTX2 interaction was confirmed by exchanging the vectors ,  and the interacting domain was mapped by testing a set of both 5' and 3' deletion constructs.
The central region of PROTX2 ,  when used as a bait in two - hybrid system ,  showed strong binding to the fibronectin (FN )  type III - like repeats 4 - 7 of PROTX1 NC1 domain.
The PROTX1 bait also interacted with PROTX2 chain domain V / III ,  and the PROTX1 /  PROTX2 chain interaction was verified by a GST - fusion protein interaction assay.
Furthermore ,  PROTX1 type I repeats showed self interaction ,  and recognized a clone for extracellular matrix protein PROTX2.
In this study ,  using yeast two - hybrid system ,  we demonstrate direct protein - protein interaction between the intracellular domains of PROTX1 and the PROTX2 subunit.
Series of expression constructs ,  sequentially deleting each domain ,  revealed that the connecting segment ,  the second pair of FNIII repeats and the tail region of the PROTX2 subunit were necessary for the interaction with PROTX1 in yeast two - hybrid system.
Further examination of the PROTX1 sequences by restricted cDNA constructs in yeast two - hybrid system identified a carboxyl - terminal segment corresponding to helix 2B domain as critical for PROTX2 binding.
The interaction of PROTX2 /  PROTX1 was confirmed by an in vitro protein - protein interaction assay ,  which also confirmed that normal human keratinocytes express PROTX1 in culture.
Collectively ,  the results suggest that PROTX2 has a relatively broad tissue distribution including specialized and simple epithelia ,  and that within the tissues such as colon and placenta ,  PROTX2 may have direct interactions with PROTX1 ,  a keratin characteristically expressed in a simple epithelia.
These and subsequent in vitro binding experiments identify a physical interaction between PROTX1 and heterochromatin protein PROTX2( PROTX2 ) .

These results indicate that anti -  PROTX2 mAb abrogated progressive leishmaniasis in BALB / c mice by suppressing the development of Th2 responses ,  substantiating a critical role of PROTX1 -  PROTX2 interaction in Th2 development in vivo.
These results indicate that (i )  the expression of PROTX1 precedes the telomerase activity which is higher in S and G2 / M phases than G1 phase ,  (ii )  PROTX2 repressed the telomerase activity in a cell cycle - dependent manner with the downregulation of PROTX1.
Recent studies have suggested that PROTX1 may be vital for regulation of PROTX2 mRNA expression and telomerase activity.
These results indicate that telomerase activity is mainly regulated by PROTX1 ,  and that PROTX2 protein is one of the positive regulators of PROTX1 in leukemic cells but is not enough to counteract the downregulation of telomerase activity by herbimycin A completely.
We describe a direct interaction between PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  and PROTX2 ,  a key factor in the regulation of apoptosis ,  by yeast two - hybrid interaction system ,  by co - immunoprecipitation ,  and by cross - linking experiments.
Our data show that PROTX1 and PROTX2 assemble into a macromolecular complex ,  and that they are released from this complex in response to an apoptotic stimulus induced by staurosporine.
Furthermore ,  significant dephosphorylation of PROTX1 was observed ,  with increased association of PROTX1 and the PROTX2 transcription factor into a transcriptionally inactive complex.
Ceramide was also capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of a PROTX0 reporter vector driven by PROTX1 binding sites containing PROTX2 promoter transfected into Hs 27 cells.
The requirement of the PROTX1 protein for ceramide - induced PROTX2 downregulation was supported by the failure of ceramide to inhibit promoter activity in HeLa cells ,  in which PROTX1 function is abrogated by the presence of the PROTX0 Papilloma virus oncoprotein ,  and in PROTX1 - deleted SAOS2 AT cells.

Ceramide - induced downregulation of the PROTX2 promoter was restored in SAOS2 #1 cells in which a functional PROTX1 gene was reintroduced.
Our studies demonstrate that PROTX1 dephosphorylation ,  induced by ceramide ,  is at least partly necessary for PROTX2 downregulation ,  and therefore the CDK - Rb - E2F pathway appears to be a target for the ceramide - induced modulation of cell cycle regulated gene transcription.
We show that in PROTX1 -  /  -  mice ,  PROTX2 - induced hyperplasia in virgin mammary gland was reduced by 70% ,  indicating that the PROTX2 signalling pathway was inhibited.
In addition ,  we show that soluble PROTX1 ectodomain purified from mouse mammary epithelial cells stimulates the activity of a PROTX2 homologue in a tissue culture assay.
Our results provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that PROTX1 can modulate Wnt signalling ,  and is critical for PROTX2 - induced tumorigenesis of the mouse mammary gland.

The most striking result of this study is that PROTX1 action in peri - Mullerian mesenchyme leads in vivo and in vitro to an accumulation of cytoplasmic PROTX2.
The co - localization of PROTX2 with PROTX1 in the nucleus of peri - Mullerian mesenchymal cells ,  demonstrated in primary culture ,  suggests that overexpressed PROTX2 in association with PROTX1 may alter transcription of target genes and may lead to changes in mesenchymal gene expression and cell fate during Mullerian duct regression.
To our knowledge ,  this is the first report that PROTX2 ,  known for its role in Wnt signaling ,  may mediate PROTX1 action.

The PROTX1 - induced apoptosis is mediated by inactivation of PROTX2 ,  whilst neutralization of the other two PROTX2 - related proteins ,  PROTX0 and 130 ,  is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis.
The PROTX1 - induced apoptosis is mediated by inactivation of PROTX0 ,  whilst neutralization of the other two pRB - related proteins ,  PROTX2 and 130 ,  is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis.
Our findings demonstrate that the PROTX1 - mediated PROTX2 destabilization is not required for its ability to drive quiescent cells into S phase and to induce apoptosis.
Interaction between PROTX1 and the PROTX2 ( PROTX2 )  is critical for the survival and proliferation of B cells during immunopoiesis.

We show here that PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  protein links PROTX2 to the holoenzyme complex.
The region of PROTX2 which interacts with PROTX1 and ,  thus ,  the holoenzyme complex ,  corresponds to subregions of the BRCT domain of PROTX2 (ref.9 ) .
This interaction was shown to occur in yeast nuclei ,  and expression in human cells of a truncated PROTX1 molecule which retains binding to PROTX2 inhibited transcriptional activation mediated by the PROTX2 carboxy terminus.
Thus ,  our results demonstrate that the importance of PROTX2 /  PROTX1 interaction for activation of PROTX0+ T cells varies between viruses and over time.
In contrast ,  the well characterized agonist - dependent interaction between the PROTX1 and the regulatory protein PROTX2 could be monitored by BRET.
PROTX1 - responsive thymocyte suspensions were enriched in cells expressing the PROTX1 receptor ,  PROTX2 ,  selectively localized to the medulla ,  and in PROTX0+ cells ,  whereas PROTX0 - responsive thymocytes never expressed PROTX0.
We suggest therefore that PROTX0 - expressing PROTX1 - producing medullary epithelial cells attract PROTX2 - expressing thymocytes ,  thus favoring the PROTX0 /  PROTX0 interaction ,  and therefore the apoptosis ,  of cells that are induced to express PROTX0 by autoantigen activation.

PROTX1 interacts strongly with the P - domain of PROTX2 (the domain which has high Ca2+ - binding affinity and chaperone function )  as revealed by direct protein - protein interaction ,  ligand blotting ,  and the yeast two - hybrid techniques.
Our results suggest that PROTX2 may act as Ca2+ - regulated chaperone for PROTX1.

In accordance with these observations ,  we found that PROTX1ould not suppress BrdUrd uptake in primary fibroblasts from PROTX2 -  /  -  mice and exhibited an intermediate ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in PROTX2+ /  -  as compared with PROTX2+ / + cells.
We further found that the PROTX1 protein complexes with the hypophosphorylated form of PROTX2.
This binding is localized to amino acids 304 - 394 of PROTX1 protein and requires the ABC domain of PROTX2.
In - frame deletion of PROTX1 fragment involved in interaction with PROTX2 completely abolished the growth - suppressive property of PROTX1.
Although it has been reported that PROTX1 interacts with PROTX2 ,  we find the PROTX2 status did not affect the ability of PROTX1 to suppress colony formation.
Our data suggest that the growth suppressor function of PROTX1 depends ,  at least in part ,  on PROTX2.
In the present study ,  we investigated the role of PROTX1 and its receptor ,  PROTX2 ,  in the chemotactic interaction between non - Hodgkin B - lymphoma cells and lymph node stromal cells.
All B - lymphoma cells freshly isolated from these patients and most laboratory B - lymphoma cell lines ,  including follicular ,  diffuse large ,  and Burkitt's lymphoma cells ,  expressed surface PROTX2 and migrated in the presence of recombinant human PROTX1alpha.
Chemotaxis assays revealed that PROTX2 - positive (but not PROTX2 - negative )  B - lymphoma cells migrated towards lymph node stromal cells ,  and this migration was almost completely inhibited by the addition of anti -  PROTX2 monoclonal antibody to the lymphoma cells or of anti -  PROTX1 neutralizing antibody to the culture supernatant of the stromal cells.
These data strongly suggest that PROTX1 /  PROTX2 is the main chemokine system involved in the chemotactic interaction between B - lymphoma cells and lymph node stromal cells.

We have identified a new PDZ protein we named PROTX1 ( PROTX0 interacting protein )  that acts as an adaptor for the receptor PROTX2 in epithelia.
The PROTX1 - binding site in PROTX2 has a critical role in restricting this receptor to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells ,  as mutation of the PROTX1 - binding site leads to the mislocalization of the receptor in these cells.

The production ,  survival and function of monocytes and macrophages are regulated by the macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( PROTX1 or PROTX0 )  through its tyrosine kinase receptor PROTX2.
Binding of PROTX1 results in PROTX2 autophosphorylation on specific tyrosines that act as docking sites for intracellular signaling molecules containing SH2 domains.
Accordingly ,  PROTX1 interacts with activated PROTX2 on phosphorylated Tyr697 ,  which is also the PROTX0 - binding site.
 PROTX2 expression is restricted to two hematopoietic tissues: the spleen and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ,  and is induced rapidly during monocytic differentiation of the myeloid NFS - 60 cell line in response to PROTX1.

By pull - down assays and the yeast two - hybrid system ,  the POU domain of PROTX0 and PROTX1 was shown to interact with the DNA - binding domain of the PROTX2.
 PROTX1 -  PROTX0 interactions also affect transcriptional activity of an PROTX2E - containing promoter ,  such that in estradiol - stimulated cells ,  PROTX1b strongly activated the promoter via the PROTX2E ,  while PROTX1a had a mild inhibitory effect.
The POU domain of PROTX1 which interacts with the PROTX2 was sufficient to confer this activation potential ,  and the change of a single amino acid in the first helix of the POU homeodomain of PROTX0 to its equivalent in PROTX1 can change the mild repressive effect of PROTX0 to a stimulatory PROTX1 - like effect.
In the presence of activated PROTX1 ,  the level of PROTX2 mRNA expression was markedly decreased (> 200 - fold )  and cell growth rate was elevated.
When treated with PROTX1 inhibitor ,  BZA - 5B ,  there was a moderate reversal of PROTX2 mRNA expression (2 - fold )  with a parallel decrease in cell growth.

This percentage of PROTX0 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far ,  and directly implicates PROTX2 /  PROTX1 misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.
In the yeast two - hybrid library screening ,  the heart - specific PROTX1 protein was found to interact with PROTX2.
In vitro interaction study between PROTX1 protein and PROTX2 was demonstrated.
From the results of domain studies by the yeast two - hybrid assay ,  the second and third LIM domains in conjunction with the first half LIM domain of PROTX1 were identified to be important in binding with PROTX2.
Our results imply that PROTX1 protein may associate with cancer development and may act as a molecular adapter to form a multicomplex with PROTX2 in the nucleus ,  thus it plays an important role in the specification or maintenance of the terminal differentiated phenotype of heart muscle cells.

In the process of searching for molecules that are preferentially expressed by the vertebrate retinal pigment epithelium (RPE )  ,  we identified PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  ,  a member of the SFRP family that appears to act by modulating PROTX2 signal transduction.
Consistent with PROTX1 's postulated role in modulating Wnt signaling in the retina ,  it inhibits the ability of X PROTX2 mRNA to induce axis duplication in Xenopus embryos.
This PROTX1 - associated cell cycle arrest is associated both with significant inhibition of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product ( PROTX0 )  and with the formation of complexes between PROTX1 and PROTX2 in VSMCs.
Taken together ,  these studies demonstrate the important role of PROTX1 in regulating PROTX2 phosphorylation and cell cycle progression in VSMC ,  and suggest a novel cytostatic gene therapy approach for restenosis and related vascular proliferative disorders.
Induction of transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus 1 long terminal repeat by the PROTX1 (p65 )  PROTX0 subunit has been shown to be dependent upon an interaction with the zinc finger DNA - binding domain of PROTX2.

Similar to the interaction with PROTX0 ,  the Rel homology domain of PROTX1 interacts with the zinc finger domain of PROTX2.
Surprisingly ,  and in contrast to PROTX0 ,  PROTX2 specifically represses PROTX1 transcriptional activity through its zinc finger domain.
Moreover ,  the interaction between PROTX1 and the PROTX2 zinc fingers is mutually exclusive with DNA binding suggesting a model in which PROTX2 directly sequesters PROTX0 from its target promoters.

Our previous studies have shown that activation of a PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  (also known as PROTX1 )  is required for dexamethasone (Dex )  - induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM )  cells and that human PROTX2 ( PROTX2 )  ,  a known growth and survival factor for MM cells ,  blocks both PROTX1 activation and apoptosis induced by Dex.

 PROTX1 interacts with PROTX2 through a region other than its PROTX0 homology 2 domains.
We demonstrate that PROTX2 is a direct substrate of PROTX1 both in vitro and in vivo ,  and that Tyr(906 )  in the C - terminal domain of PROTX2 mediates its interaction with PROTX1.
Moreover ,  overexpression of dominant negative PROTX1 blocked the protective effect of PROTX2 against Dex - induced apoptosis.
These findings demonstrate that PROTX1 mediates the anti - apoptotic effect of PROTX2 and suggest PROTX1 as a novel therapeutic target in MM.
Proteolytic cleavage of single - chain high molecular weight PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  by PROTX2 releases the short - lived vasodilator PROTX0 and leaves behind 2 - chain high molecular weight PROTX0 ( PROTX0 )  that has been previously reported to exert antiadhesive properties as well as to bind to the urokinase receptor ( PROTX0 )  on endothelial cells.

Results presented here show that PROTX1 and PROTX2 coexist in a biochemical complex and colocalize in subnuclear foci in somatic cells and on the axial elements of developing synaptonemal complexes.
Thus ,  PROTX1 and PROTX2 participate ,  together ,  in a pathway(s )  associated with the activation of double - strand break repair and / or homologous recombination.
Although it has been suggested that heterodimerization between PROTX1 and PROTX2 is essential for the anti - death activity of PROTX1 (refs 7 , 8 )  ,  our results suggest that the interaction with PROTX2 is not required for PROTX1 to exert its death -  repressing activity.

These results indicate that mast cells enhance fibroblast - mediated contraction of collagen lattices via direct cell - cell contact ,  mediated in part by PROTX1 /  PROTX2 interactions.
As fibroblasts and mast cells are known to attach via PROTX0 ( PROTX1 )  /  PROTX2 interaction when co - cultured in monolayers ,  we also examined the effect of antibodies against PROTX1 and PROTX2 in this system.
A reconstructed clone carrying the full - length PROTX1 coding sequence also showed the ability to bind to an PROTX2 fusion protein.
Loss of interaction between PROTX1 and PROTX2 was observed either when two cysteines (Cys 32 and 35 )  in PROTX2 were substituted by serines or when the deletion in PROTX1 was extended from amino acid position 155 to 225 or beyond.
A database search indicated that PROTX2 possessed eight regions similar to regions of PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 and X - ray repair cross - complementing 1 ( PROTX0 )  proteins and a region similar to auto - modification sites of poly(ADP - ribose )  polymerase ,  suggesting that PROTX2 supported catalytic reactions of PROTX1 through transient breakages of DNA strands.
We have found that loss of PROTX0 reduces the frequency of pituitary and thyroid tumours ,  and greatly lengthens the lifespan of PROTX0(+ /  -  ) ; PROTX0( -  /  -  )  animals ,  demonstrating that PROTX2 is an important downstream target of PROTX1 during tumorigenesis.
To determine whether PROTX2 deregulation -  - as a result of loss of PROTX1 -  - promotes proliferation in vivo ,  we have tested whether loss of PROTX0 interferes with the pituitary and thyroid tumorigenesis that occurs in PROTX0(+ /  -  )  mice.
As PROTX1 is known to repress PROTX2 transcriptional activity and overexpression of PROTX2 is sufficient for cell cycle progression ,  it is thought that PROTX1 suppresses growth in part by repressing PROTX2 - mediated transcription.
Mutation of the retinoblastoma tumour - suppressor gene ( PROTX0 )  leads to the deregulation of many proteins and transcription factors that interact with the retinoblastoma gene product ( PROTX1 )  ,  including members of the PROTX2 transcription factor family.
To address the function of PROTX2 and PROTX1 /  PROTX0 complexes in vivo ,  we have produced mice homozygous for a nonfunctional PROTX2 allele.
The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( PROTX1 )  is a transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression by physically associating with transcription factors such as PROTX2 family members.
Ligand activation of the nuclear receptor PROTX1 induces adipogenesis and increases PROTX2 sensitivity ,  while activation of other PROTX0 isoforms ( - alpha and  - delta )  induces little or no fat cell differentiation.
Using this region of PROTX1 as bait ,  we have used a yeast two - hybrid screen to clone a novel protein ,  termed PROTX2 ,  containing a partial SCAN domain.
These results suggest that interactions between PROTX2 ,  a receptor isoform - selective cofactor and PROTX1a contribute to the adipogenic action of this receptor.
 PROTX1 ( PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 )  is a "macro" immunophilin that ,  although sharing high structural and functional homologies in its amino - terminal domain with PROTX0 ( PROTX0 )  ,  does not have immunosuppressant activity when complexed with PROTX2 ,  unlike PROTX0.

Unlike previous screens using wild - type PROTX1 ,  where PROTX2 predominated ,  none of the resulting colonies encoded PROTX2.
The possibility that Bcl - x(L )  inhibits cell death at a late (postmitochondrial )  step in the death pathway is supported by this report of a novel apoptosis inhibitor ,  PROTX1 ,  which binds to both Bcl - x(L )  and the caspase regulator ,  PROTX2.

Treatment of cells with PROTX0 increased the interaction between the PROTX2 oligonucleotide and nuclear PROTX1 /  PROTX0 in a time - dependent manner.
Furthermore ,  PROTX1 activated the chimeric promoter consisting of 10 tandem GAL4 - binding sites ,  which replaced the three PROTX0 - binding sites in the 12(S ) lipoxygenase promoter only when coexpressed with GAL4 -  PROTX2 ( )  fusion proteins.
These results indicate that the direct interaction between PROTX2 and PROTX0 induced by PROTX1 cooperatively activated expression of the 12(S )  - lipoxygenase gene ,  and that PROTX0 may serve at least in part as a carrier bringing PROTX2 to the promoter ,  thus transactivating the transcriptional activity of 12(S )  - lipoxygenase gene.

The PROTX1 protein is an endogenous gene product that binds to the PROTX2 protein and is able to block PROTX2 - mediated transactivation of cotransfected reporter constructs; thus ,  interactions between PROTX1 and PROTX2 in this checkpoint pathway following ionizing irradiation were examined.
In addition ,  expression of endogenous PROTX2 was enhanced by ionizing irradiation at the level of transcription in a PROTX1 - dependent fashion.
These observations demonstrate that PROTX2 overexpression can inhibit PROTX1function in a known physiologic pathway and are consistent with the hypothesis that PROTX2 may function in a "feedback loop" mechanism with PROTX0 ,  possibly acting to limit the length or severity of the PROTX0 - mediated arrest following DNA damage.
Furthermore ,  the efficient phosphorylation of S118 requires a ligand - regulated interaction of PROTX1 with AF2 ,  the activation function located in the ligand binding domain (LBD )  of PROTX2.
This interaction involves (1 )  the integrity of helix 12 of the LBD / AF2 and (2 )  PROTX1 and PROTX2 ,  two subunits of the core TFIIH.
Sequence similarities between 19K and PROTX1 are largely restricted to short Bcl -  2 homology (BH )  domains that mediate interaction with PROTX2.
The BH1 sequence in 19K is degenerate but nevertheless contains a conserved glycine residue found in all family members that when mutated to alanine in PROTX1 results in loss of PROTX1 function and ability to dimerize with PROTX2 (Yin ,  X. - M. ,  Oltvai ,  Z. N. ,  and Korsmeyer ,  S. (1994 )  Nature 369 ,  321 - 323 ) .

One amino - terminal PROTX1 peptide spanning amino acids 15 - 40 ,  antagonized PROTX1 binding and inhibition of PROTX2 /  PROTX0 kinase.
These results suggest that this peptide region is important for PROTX1 interaction with PROTX2 /  PROTX0.
A second peptide (amino acids 58 - 77 )  also antagonized PROTX1 -  activity ,  but this peptide did not affect the ability of PROTX1 to interact with PROTX2 /  PROTX0.
A region of PROTX1 larger than 26 amino acids is presumably required for PROTX2 - inhibition because none of the peptides we tested inhibited PROTX0 /  PROTX0.

In vitro ,  PROTX11 interacts with the cytosolic domain of wild type PROTX2 ,  but does not interact with mutant PROTX2 proteins that fail to target correctly when expressed in endocrine cells.
The data suggest that PROTX11 associates with vesicles in the recycling endosomal pathway ,  and may play a role in regulating the trafficking of integral membrane PROTX2.
Molecular modeling of the interaction of a PROTX1 peptide with PROTX2 has uncovered several conserved residues that are important for substrate selectivity.

Based on the x - ray and NMR structures of PROTX1 ,  these residues define a surface on PROTX1 critical for PROTX2 down - regulation.
However ,  not all PROTX1 alleles bind to PROTX2 with high affinity ,  so the role of PROTX2 during HIV infection remains uncertain.
The PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  plays a central role in apoptosis: interaction of this protein with PROTX2 leads to cleavage and activation of this initiator caspase.

These two PROTX1 act on a family of PROTX0 - associated transcriptional repressors typified by the retinoblastoma protein ( PROTX0 )  to bring about a transcriptional program that promotes passage through S phase [7 - 9] ,  but can also activate DNA replication independently of PROTX2 -  PROTX0 [10 - 12]

The protein PROTX1 ( PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 )  is a potent inhibitor of cyclin - dependent kinases ( PROTX2 ) .
 PROTX0 can also block DNA replication through its interaction with the PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  ,  which is an auxiliary factor for PROTX2.
Previous studies have yielded contradictory results on whether PROTX1 regulates NER through its interaction with PROTX2.
Hence ,  we have investigated the effect of PROTX1 on NER both in vitro and in vivo using purified fragments of PROTX1 containing either the PROTX2 - binding domain (N terminus )  or the PROTX0 binding domain (C terminus )  of the protein.
Hence ,  we have investigated the effect of PROTX1 on NER both in vitro and in vivo using purified fragments of PROTX1 containing either the PROTX0 - binding domain (N terminus )  or the PROTX2 binding domain (C terminus )  of the protein.
A 50% inhibition of in vitro NER occurred at a 50:1 molar ratio of PROTX1 C - terminus fragment to PROTX2 monomer.
It also appears that preassembly of PROTX2 at repair sites mitigates the inhibitory effect of PROTX1.
We further demonstrate that the inhibition of DNA repair is mediated via binding of PROTX1 to PROTX2.
The N terminus of PROTX1 had no effect on DNA repair ,  and the inhibition of DNA repair by the C terminus of PROTX1 was relieved by the addition of purified PROTX2 protein.
Here we identify PROTX1 and PROTX0 as proteins that interact with PROTX2p.
Here we identify PROTX0 and PROTX1 as proteins that interact with PROTX2p.
These results suggest that PROTX2p and the PROTX1 participate in a common DNA metabolic pathway.
Results from this study indicate that the checkpoint protein kinase PROTX1 (mutated in ataxia telangiectasia )  was required for phosphorylation of PROTX2 in response to ionizing radiation.
 PROTX1 resides in a complex with PROTX2 and phosphorylated PROTX2 in vivo and in vitro in a region that contains clusters of serine - glutamine residues.
Thus ,  phosphorylation of PROTX2 by the checkpoint kinase PROTX1 may be critical for proper responses to DNA double - strand breaks and may provide a molecular explanation for the role of PROTX1 in breast cancer.
Additionally ,  we show that PROTX1 also interacts with PROTX2 ,  a cellular acetyltransferase.
The interactions of PROTX1 with PROTX0 and PROTX2 provide new evidence implicating this essential EBV protein PROTX1 in modulating the acetylation of cellular factors ,  including histones.

The transcription factors PROTX1 and PROTX2 cooperate in repression of transcription from the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat (LTR ) .
We find that PROTX1 copurifies with the LTR - binding PROTX2 -  PROTX0 repressor complex ,  the domain of PROTX2 that interacts with PROTX1 is required to repress the HIV - 1 promoter ,  expression of PROTX1 augments repression of the LTR by PROTX2 ,  and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocks repression mediated by PROTX2.

PROTX1 and PROTX2 may establish transcriptional and virological latency of HIV ,  a state that has recently been recognized in vivo and has significant implications for the long - term treatment of AIDS.
Insulin - like growth factor (IGF )  - binding protein - 3 ( PROTX1 )  is known to be secreted as a phosphoprotein ,  constitutively phosphorylated at PROTX2 ( PROTX2 )  sites.
To examine the effect of phosphorylation by PROTX2 on the properties of glycosylated human PROTX1 ,  we phosphorylated plasma - derived PROTX1 ,  containing less than 1 mol / mol phosphoserine ,  in vitro.
Phospho -  PROTX1 showed significant resistance to proteolysis by PROTX2 and a cysteine protease secreted by MCF - 7 cells.
Relative resistance to proteolysis and poor binding to cells suggest that PROTX2 - phospho -  PROTX1 may be a significant inhibitor of PROTX0 activity in the extracellular environment.
Human PROTX2 has previously been shown to interact with PROTX1 ,  and we have extended this analysis to show that both PROTX0 and IIbeta interact with PROTX1 in vivo and in vitro.
Human PROTX0 has previously been shown to interact with PROTX1 ,  and we have extended this analysis to show that both PROTX2 and IIbeta interact with PROTX1 in vivo and in vitro.
Furthermore ,  we show that the regulatory C - terminal basic region of PROTX1 (residues 364 - 393 )  is necessary and sufficient for interaction with PROTX2.
As PROTX0 regulates motility through the interaction of PROTX1 with its receptor ,  the PROTX2 ,  we identified this receptor in human preadipocytes.
As PROTX1 regulates motility through the interaction of PROTX2 with its receptor ,  the PROTX0 ,  we identified this receptor in human preadipocytes.

As PROTX0 regulates motility through the interaction of PROTX1 with its receptor ,  the PROTX2 ,  we identified this receptor in human preadipocytes.
Functional studies indicated that active ,  but not latent ,  PROTX1 inhibited preadipocyte attachment to PROTX2 with an IC(50 )  of 13.3 nmol / L ,  and preincubation of PROTX2 - coated Transwells with active PROTX1 prevented preadipocyte migration.
These data indicate that human preadipocyte migration is regulated through the endogenous expression of PROTX1 and PROTX2 ,  a novel autocrine mechanism for potentially regulating cell cluster formation in adipogenesis.
Translation of most mRNAs requires formation of a cap - binding initiation complex known as PROTX0 ,  consisting of factors PROTX1 ,  PROTX2 ,  PROTX1 kinase PROTX0 ,  poly(A )  - binding protein ,  and adaptor protein PROTX0.

 PROTX1 specifically bound PROTX2 during heat shock ,  preventing assembly of the cap - initiation /  PROTX0 complex and trapping PROTX2 in insoluble heat shock granules.
Dissociation of PROTX2 was enhanced during heat shock by ectopic overexpression of PROTX1 ,  the murine homolog of human PROTX0.
Overexpression of PROTX1 ,  a constitutive homolog of PROTX0 ,  prevented loss of cap - initiation complexes and maintained PROTX2 solubility.
Purified PROTX1 specifically bound purified PROTX2 in vitro ,  prevented in vitro translation ,  eliminated PROTX2 interaction with protein binding factors ,  and promoted PROTX2 insolubilization.
These results therefore demonstrate that PROTX1 is a heat - induced inhibitor of PROTX2 - dependent mRNA translation.
Similarly ,  expression of an active form of the PROTX0 ( PROTX1 (1 - 490 )  )  down - regulated PROTX2 expression by 50% and decreased caveolar PLD activity by 60%.
These data identify the PLD activity in caveolin - rich membranes as PROTX1 and provide in vivo evidence suggesting that PROTX2 regulates PROTX1 activity.
EBV binds to PROTX1 through its major envelope PROTX2 ( PROTX2 ) .
Here we show that ,  in contrast to infectious EBV ,  purified recombinant PROTX1 upregulates PROTX2 gene expression in human monocyte / macrophages (M / M )  as well as in a monocytoid cell line ,  U937.
Our results also demonstrate that this increased expression is due to both enhanced transcription and stability of PROTX2 mRNA in PROTX1 - treated cells.
The specificity of this effect is evidenced by the fact that pre - incubation of cells with anti -  PROTX2 monoclonal antibody OKB7 ,  which blocks binding of PROTX1 to PROTX2 ,  inhibits the above mentioned effects of PROTX1.
Furthermore ,  we demonstrate that activation of PROTX0 by PROTX1 is mediated by PROTX2 through signal transduction pathways involving PROTX0 ,  PROTX0 and tyrosine kinases.

Cellular proteins such as histone deacetylases 1 and 2 ( PROTX1 and  - 2 )  also contain an LXCXE - like sequence ,  which they use to interact with PROTX2.
Mutation of the LXCXE binding site inhibited active transcriptional repression by PROTX1 and prevented it from effectively repressing the PROTX2 and A gene promoters.
In contrast ,  mutations in the LXCXE binding site did not prevent PROTX1 from binding and inactivating PROTX2.
Thus ,  the LXCXE mutations appear to separate PROTX1's ability to bind and inactivate PROTX2 from its ability to efficiently recruit PROTX0 and  - 2 and actively repress transcription.
Thus ,  the LXCXE mutations appear to separate PROTX1's ability to bind and inactivate PROTX0 from its ability to efficiently recruit PROTX2 and  - 2 and actively repress transcription.
Mutation of the LXCXE binding site does not inhibit binding of the PROTX2 ATPase component of the PROTX0 nucleosome remodeling complex ,  which has been shown previously to be important for PROTX1 function.
Indeed ,  overexpression of PROTX2 and PROTX1 in cells deficient for the proteins led to stable growth inhibition ,  suggesting a cooperative role for PROTX0 and the LXCXE binding site in efficient PROTX1 function.

Here we report that expression of PROTX1 in the developing midbrain of PROTX2 - null embryos is sufficient to rescue early midbrain and anterior hindbrain development.
This suggests that a key role of PROTX2 signalling is to maintain PROTX1 expression and that this aspect of the PROTX2 /  PROTX1grailed interaction has be PROTX1 conserved from flies to mice.
We used a biochemical screen to identify PROTX2 ,  a key factor in ribosome biogenesis ,  as a high - affinity binding partner for the heterotrimeric human replication protein A ( PROTX1 ) .
Binding studies in vitro demonstrated that the two proteins physically interact ,  with PROTX2 using an unusual contact with the PROTX1.
Nucleolin significantly inhibited both simian virus 40 (SV - 40 )  origin unwinding and SV - 40 DNA replication in vitro ,  likely by PROTX2 preventing PROTX1 from productive interaction with the SV - 40 initiation complex.
Nucleolin relocalization was concomitant with a tenfold increase in PROTX2 -  PROTX1 complex formation.
In this study the interaction between PROTX1 and the PROTX2 tetramer has been examined.
We provide evidence that in proliferating cells: (i )  PROTX1 is physically associated with the PROTX2 tetramer ,  an association confirmed by confocal microscopy ,  demonstrating that both enzymes are co - localized at the nuclear periphery of HeLa cells; (ii )  this interaction requires the integrity of the second zinc finger of PROTX1 and is maximal during the S and G2 / M phases of the cell cycle; (iii )  PROTX1 - deficient cells derived from PROTX1 knock - out mice exhibited reduced DNA polymerase activity ,  compared with the parental cells ,  a reduction accentuated following exposure to sublethal doses of methylmethanesulfonate
We demonstrated that PROTX2 deficiency does not affect PROTX1 activity in human cell lines or PROTX2 - deficient mouse tissues ,  nor does it alter PROTX1 activity induced by oxidative damage or gamma - irradiation.
Our results support a model in which PROTX1 and PROTX2 could be involved in distinct pathways ,  both effectors transducing the damage signal to cell cycle regulators
We provided evidence that PROTX1 constitutively interacts with PROTX2.
When both PROTX1 and PROTX2 were absent ,  the two repair pathways were dramatically affected ,  indicating that base excision repair was highly inefficient.

The interaction of oxidized (ox -  )  PROTX1 with PROTX2 and anti PROTX1 III - heparin complex were most sensitive to oxidation ,  being the kcat / Km value for PROTX2 hydrolysis roughly reduced 13 - fold and the affinity for the anti PROTX1 III - heparin complex decreased approximately 15 - fold.
Ox -  PROTX1 was also characterized by a 5 - fold decrease of the kcat / Km value for both fibrinopeptide A and B release from PROTX2 ,  a 5.8 - fold increase of the EC50 value for platelet activation and a 2 - fold decrease of binding affinity for PROTX0.

The above results indicate a high sensitivity of PROTX1 to oxidative modifications by PROTX2.
Perturbed interactions with PROTX2 and the heparin -  PROTX0 complex were the most relevant functional abnormalities of ox -  PROTX1.
 PROTX1 has been implicated in the response to ultraviolet (UV )  radiation and blocks to DNA synthesis [8] [9] [10] [11] ,  and may phosphorylate PROTX2 [12] [13] ,  suggesting that PROTX0 and PROTX1 may have similar and ,  perhaps ,  complementary roles in cell - cycle control after DNA damage.
Thus alterations in the PROTX2 gene frequently are selected for during liver tumorigenesis and suggest that disregulation of the PROTX1 -  PROTX0 pathway is a major event in the development of HCC in humans and mice.

Mismatch recognition is attributed to two heterodimeric protein complexes: PROTX0 (refs 2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 )  ,  a dimer of PROTX0 homologues PROTX1 and PROTX2; and PROTX0 (refs 2 , 7 )  ,  a dimer of PROTX1 and PROTX0.

 PROTX0 deficiency did not cause cancer predisposition ,  but in an PROTX1  - deficient background ,  loss of PROTX2 accelerated intestinal tumorigenesis.
Furthermore ,  mismatch - directed anti - recombination and sensitivity to methylating agents required PROTX2 and PROTX1 ,  but not Msh3.
Thus ,  loss of MMR functions specific to PROTX2 /  PROTX1 is sufficient for lymphoma development in mice ,  whereas predisposition to intestinal cancer requires loss of function of both PROTX2 /  PROTX1 and PROTX2 /  PROTX0.
We characterized the PROTX1 protein expression in immortalized cells from AT and AT - variant patients ,  and heterozygotes and correlated it with two PROTX1 - dependent radiation responses ,  G1 checkpoint arrest and PROTX2 - Ser 15 phosphorylation.
However ,  this limited expression of PROTX1 protein provides no benefit regarding the PROTX1 - dependent responses related to G1 arrest and PROTX2 - ser15 phosphorylation.

PROTX1 proteins can mediate PROTX0 ( PROTX2 )  - inducible transcriptional responses.
In an effort to search for PROTX2 - inducible genes ,  we used a subtractive screening method and identified human PROTX1 ,  which can antagonize PROTX2 signaling and is rapidly up - regulated by PROTX2.
In this report ,  we show that PROTX2 can stabilize PROTX1 mRNA and activate PROTX1 transcription.
We demonstrate that on PROTX1 treatment ,  endogenous PROTX2 complex can bind to a PROTX27 promoter DNA as short as 14 or 16 bp that contains the 8 - bp SBE in gel mobility shift and supershift assays.
The PROTX1 promoter is the first PROTX2 responsive promoter identified in vertebrates that contains the 8 - bp palindromic PROTX0 - binding element (SBE )  ,  an optimal binding site previously identified by a PCR - based selection from random oligonucleotides by using recombinant PROTX0 and PROTX0.
Our studies provide strong evidence that PROTX2 proteins can bind to a natural PROTX1 responsive promoter independent of other sequence specific transcription factors.
We further show that ,  whereas recombinant PROTX1 binds to the SBE ,  endogenous or even transfected PROTX1 cannot bind to the SBE in the absence of PROTX2.
These findings have important implications in the identification of target genes of the PROTX1 /  PROTX2 signaling pathways.

The failure of zinc - finger mutant PROTX1 in NER may be explained by the observation that wild - type PROTX1 significantly stimulated PROTX2 activity ,  whereas only marginal stimulation was observed with zinc - finger mutant PROTX1.

We have recently reported that the PROTX1 inhibitor GGTI - 298 arrests human tumor cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and increases the protein and RNA levels of the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor PROTX2.
This upregulation of PROTX1 promoter was selective, since GGTI - 298 inhibited serum responsive element -  and PROTX2 - mediated transcription.
Moreover, GGTI - 298 treatment also resulted in increased PROTX1 and PROTX2 phosphorylation.

However, colocalization of PROTX1 and PROTX2 in PODs is only transient, with both proteins subsequently redistributing into a nuclear diffuse form.
To examine the mechanism of PROTX2 displacement by PROTX1, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assay experiments with plasmids expressing intact or deleted forms of PROTX2 and PROTX1 in DNA - transfected cells.
The results demonstrated that deletion of the C - terminal acidic region of PROTX1 uncouples the requirements for displacement of both endogenous and coexpressed PROTX2 from those needed to target to the PODs.
Mutant PROTX2 proteins containing either a Cys point mutation within the N - terminal RING finger domain or a small deletion (of positions 281 to 304) within the coiled - coil region did not localize to the PODs but instead gave a nuclear diffuse distribution, similar to that produced by intact PROTX2 in the presence of PROTX1.
Endogenous PROTX2 also colocalized with PROTX1 in metaphase chromosomes in HCMV or recombinant adenovirus type 5 - PROTX1 - infected HF cells undergoing mitosis, implying that there may be a direct physical interaction between PROTX1 and PROTX2.
Here, we characterize a novel cellular protein interacting with the basic domains of PROTX1 and PROTX2, and competing of their binding to the AP1 consensus site.
A portion of the intracellular domain of PROTX1, used as a bait in a yeast two - hybrid screen of an epidermal keratinocyte cDNA library, identified overlapping cDNA clones that showed a high degree of homology to PROTX2 and other members of the plakin family of intermediate filament connector molecules.

We have characterized the functions of various forms of PROTX1 and PROTX2 bearing point mutations or deletions.
In addition, the mutants containing only the third RRM failed to induce the neuronal phenotype in PC12 cells and inhibited the biologic activity of cotransfected wild - type PROTX1 and PROTX2, thus acting as a dominant - negative form.
PROTX1 and PROTX2 induced the ectopic expression of neuronal markers, whereas the dominant - negative forms of PROTX1 and PROTX2 suppressed the differentiation of central nervous system motor neurons.

Reactivity to both PROTX1 and PROTX2 was localized to cells of the medullary areas, but never in the cortex.
Double immunostaining showed no reactivity for either PROTX1 or PROTX2 by T cells, macrophages, or mature dendritic cells, whereas many medullary epithelial cells were reactive to PROTX1 or PROTX2.

PROTX1 and PROTX2 proto - oncogenes have been implicated in the development of midbrain and hindbrain structures.
Antisense knockout of PROTX2, a gene structurally related to PROTX1, targeted the forebrain and midbrain region, which were hypoplastic and failed to expand, and the spinal cord, which exhibited lateral outpocketings at the level of the forelimb buds.
Dual antisense knockouts of PROTX1 and PROTX2 targeted all brain regions leading to incomplete closure of the cranial neural folds, and an increase in the number and severity of outpocketings along the spinal cord, suggesting that these genes complement one another to produce normal patterning of the spinal cord.

PROTX1 and PROTX2 were identified as potential interaction partners for this protein in a yeast two - hybrid screen.
This directly demonstrates that in the same cell at least the major proportion of PROTX1 and PROTX2 is localized in different cellular compartments.
We asked whether the acetylase PROTX1 - binding protein (PROTX2) could acetylate proteins not directly involved in transcription.
By comparing the context of Lys22 with the sequences of other known substrates of PROTX1 and the closely related acetylase PROTX2, we identified G / SK (in the single - letter amino acid code) as a consensus acetylation motif.

The small GTPases PROTX1, Rac and PROTX2 have important regulatory roles in mediating cytoskeletal rearrangements, MAP kinase cascades and induction of G1 cell cycle progression.
We have shown in vitro and in vivo that the first GEF domain (GEFD1) activates PROTX1, while the second GEF domain (GEFD2) acts on PROTX2.
Nuclei from undifferentiated SH - SY5Y cells were found to be immunoreactive to anti - PROTX1 and anti - PROTX2 antibodies.
Under these conditions, both anti - PROTX1 and anti - PROTX2 immunoreactivities were still detectable, although the signals were somewhat less intense.
When these cells were exposed for 2 h to neurotoxic concentrations of doxorubicin (50 nM), they exhibited a marked and homogeneous increase of both anti - PROTX1 and anti - PROTX2 immunoreactivities.
Using RT - PCR technology, we also found that doxorubicin treatment did not change PROTX1 or PROTX2 mRNA levels.

Both for PROTX1 and PROTX2, the lowest levels were obtained with pathogenic mycobacterial species, whereas about 2 - 8 times higher levels were observed for non - pathogenic species.
Contrary to the above, the differences for PROTX1 and PROTX2 were not marked, although PROTX1 appeared to be more elevated for non - pathogenic species.
Heat - killed bacteria induced a lower level of the cytokines for all the three cytokines assayed (PROTX1, PROTX2 and PROTX0), except for M.tuberculosis for whom a significantly higher proportion of PROTX1 was induced by killed bacilli.

Mammalian PROTX1 (PROTX1) carries out most base excision repair synthesis and also can excise deoxyribose 5 - phosphate after PROTX2 incision.
After incision by PROTX2, only PROTX1 exhibits stable DNA binding.
We have therefore determined whether these stable growth properties of plaque VSMCs reflect altered activity of PROTX1 and / or PROTX2.
Compared with normal VSMCs, plaque VSMCs showed a higher ratio of the active (hypophosphorylated) to the inactive (phosphorylated) form of PROTX1 and a lower level of PROTX2 transcriptional activity.
Suppression of PROTX2 and PROTX1 together had similar effects but, additionally, resulted in immortalization of normal VSMC cultures.
Suppression of PROTX1 and PROTX2 together increased cell proliferation and delayed senescence but failed to immortalize plaque VSMCs.
In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle (hcaVSM) cells, the mechanisms that mediate the antiproliferative effects of ligands for the PROTX1 (PROTX1) and the PROTX2 (PROTX2) are unclear.
Accordingly, we determined whether the antiproliferative activity of the PROTX1 ligands, troglitazone or 15 - deoxy - Delta - 12,14 - prostaglandin J2 (15d - PGJ2), was enhanced with the PROTX2 ligand, 9 - cis - retinoic acid (9 - cis - RA).

Microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumors from patients with hereditary non - polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, principally PROTX1 and PROTX2.
To contribute to the characterization of MSI in gastric cancer and to directly investigate whether PROTX1 promoter methylation is accompanied by gene mutation in these cancers, we have analyzed 42 gastric tumors and corresponding normal tissue for MSI, hypermethylation of the PROTX1 promoter, and mutations in PROTX1 as well as PROTX2.
All samples with at least 2 altered loci exhibited methylation of the PROTX1 promoter region, but none had detectable mutations in PROTX1 or PROTX2.
We demonstrate that under physiological conditions, PROTX1 does not impact the ability of PROTX2 to induce cell proliferation or up - regulate Ca(2+).
Mutations in breast cancer tumor susceptibility genes, PROTX1 and PROTX2, predispose women to early onset breast cancer and other malignancies.
This cell death program was insensitive to pertussis toxin and did not involve activation of the stress -  and apoptosis - related PROTX1(MAPK) and PROTX2 but was inhibited by a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (z - VAD.fmk) and a relatively selective inhibitor of PROTX0 (z - DEVD.fmk).

Although the predicted protein product of the PROTX1 gene has only 38% amino acid identity with PROTX2, it exhibits significant conservation of structural properties, including a hydrophobic signal sequence and invariant spacing and conservation of 22 cysteine residues.
We have sought to characterize the biological and biochemical properties of Wnt family members and here present a characterization of PROTX1 protein and a comparison with PROTX2.
Secreted PROTX1 protein was detected in the culture medium only after cells were treated with suramin indicating that, like PROTX2 protein, PROTX1 is tightly associated with the cell surface.
Expression of PROTX1 cDNA in the mammary epithelial cell line C57 mg results in loss of density - inhibited growth and induces a transformed phenotype in monolayer culture similar to the effects produced by PROTX2.
These results indicate that PROTX1 shares several biochemical and biological characteristics with PROTX2 and suggests that other Wnt family members, by virtue of conserved structural features, may also exhibit similar properties.

To better define these roles, we have used two previously characterized lines of genetically altered mice: estrogen receptor - alpha (PROTX1) knockout (ERKO) mice, which lack the gene encoding PROTX1, and mouse mammary virus tumor (MMTV) - PROTX2 transgenic mice (PROTX2 TG), which develop mammary hyperplasia and neoplasia due to ectopic production of the PROTX2 secretory glycoprotein.
We have crossed these lines to ascertain the effects of PROTX1 deficiency on mammary gland development and carcinogenesis in mice expressing the PROTX2 transgene.
Introduction of the PROTX2 transgene into the ERKO background stimulates proliferation of alveolar - like epithelium, indicating that PROTX2 protein can promote mitogenesis in the absence of an PROTX1 - mediated response.
The hyperplastic glandular tissue remains confined to the nipple region, implying that the requirement for PROTX1 in ductal expansion is not overcome by ectopic PROTX2.
Tumors were detected in virgin ERKO females expressing the PROTX2 transgene at an average age (48 weeks) that is twice that seen in virgin PROTX2 TG mice (24 weeks) competent to produce PROTX1.
Small hyperplastic mammary glands were observed in PROTX2 TG males, regardless of PROTX1 gene status; the glands were similar in appearance to those found in ERKO / PROTX2 TG females.
Mammary tumors also occurred in PROTX2 TG males; latency tended to be longer in the heterozygous PROTX1 and ERKO males (86 to 100 weeks) than in wild - type PROTX1 mice (ca. 75 weeks).
We conclude that ectopic expression of the PROTX2 proto - oncogene can induce mammary hyperplasia and tumorigenesis in the absence of PROTX1 in female and male mice.
These clones were examined for their responsiveness to agents known to activate or interfere with PROTX1 (PROTX1) -  and PROTX2 (PROTX2) - dependent pathways.
WS1 and WS3 are due to mutations in the PROTX1 gene whereas some WS2 cases are associated with mutations in the PROTX2 (PROTX2) gene.
This propensity was also confirmed in LAN - 5 human neuroblastoma cells, where phosphorylation of the PROTX2 C - terminal domain and expression of PROTX1 also decreased remarkably in the late neural differentiation stages.
This interaction apparently does not require the integrity of the PROTX1 complex, as it was found to occur with extracts from cells deficient in the PROTX2, one of the components of the PROTX1 complex.
PROTX1 and PROTX2 colocalize to the lateral membrane of human intestinal epithelial cells.
We have constructed the gene by cloning a phage display optimised PROTX1 - binding peptide into the active - site loop of PROTX2.
PROTX1 contains one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains related to the PROTX2 adaptor.
Strikingly, overexpression of PROTX1 in bone marrow cells results in strong reduction of PROTX2 - dependent macrophage production in vitro.
This interaction was repeat length dependent and specific to PROTX1 171; the co - repressor did not interact with the repeat carrying a section of PROTX2 nor with the PROTX0 or polyglutamine alone.

We have used PROTX1 and PROTX2 antibodies in immunohistochemical studies and find that in Huntington's disease (HD) cortex and caudate, the cellular localization of these proteins is exclusively cytoplasmic whilst in control brain they are localized in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm; PROTX2 immunoreactivity also occurred in a subset of PROTX0 positive intranuclear inclusions.

Here, we used pulse - chase analysis to show that the in vivo loss of PROTX1 protein in PROTX2 - immortalized MECs is a consequence of enhanced degradation.
Treatment of PROTX2 - immortalized MECs with aldehyde inhibitors of proteasome - associated proteases led to a marked stabilization of PROTX1 protein, particularly the hypophosphorylated form.
We have previously determined the structure of the chromo domain from the mouse PROTX1 protein, PROTX2.
Mapping studies, with fragments of the PROTX1 and PROTX2 proteins, show that an intact, dimeric, shadow chromo domain structure is required for complex formation.
To test these ideas, we have examined telomere dynamics and PROTX1 activation during mammary tumorigenesis in mice carrying a mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat - driven PROTX2 transgene.
We also analyzed PROTX2 - induced mammary tumors in mice lacking PROTX1 function.
The expression of PROTX1 RNA correlated strongly with PROTX2 mRNA in all normal tissues and tumors, indicating that the RNA component of PROTX1 is regulated with cell proliferation.
One component of human telomeres is the TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1 (PROTX1), a ubiquitously expressed protein, related to the protooncogene PROTX0, that is present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle.

Here we report the cloning of PROTX2, a distant homologue of PROTX1 that carries a very similar PROTX0 - related DNA - binding motif.
Here we report the cloning of PROTX0, a distant homologue of PROTX1 that carries a very similar PROTX2 - related DNA - binding motif.
Here we report the cloning of PROTX1, a distant homologue of PROTX0 that carries a very similar PROTX2 - related DNA - binding motif.
Like PROTX1, PROTX2 was ubiquitously expressed, bound specifically to duplex TTAGGG repeats in vitro and localized to all human telomeres in metaphase chromosomes.
PROTX2 was shown to have an architecture similar to that of PROTX1 in that it carries a C - terminal PROTX0 motif and a large PROTX1 - related dimerization domain near its N terminus.
PROTX0 was shown to have an architecture similar to that of PROTX1 in that it carries a C - terminal PROTX2 motif and a large PROTX1 - related dimerization domain near its N terminus.
PROTX1 was shown to have an architecture similar to that of PROTX0 in that it carries a C - terminal PROTX2 motif and a large PROTX0 - related dimerization domain near its N terminus.
However, the dimerization domains of PROTX1 and PROTX2 did not interact, suggesting that these proteins exist predominantly as homodimers.
While having similar telomere binding activity and domain organization, PROTX2 differed from PROTX1 in that its N terminus was basic rather than acidic, and PROTX2 was much more conserved than PROTX1.
Because PROTX1 and PROTX2 showed significant differences, we suggest that these factors have distinct functions at telomeres.
We found that PROTX1 contains two putative leucine zipper domains sharing peculiar homology with the alpha motif of human PROTX2.
Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the PROTX1 protein is a new member of the PROTX2 - like family, which comprises numerous members involved in a broad range of biological functions: transcriptional regulation, DNA repair and chromosome segregation.
These results show that PROTX1 is a component of the PROTX2 and that PROTX1 is required for the transcriptional repression mediated by this complex.
The involvement of c - PROTX1 in the PROTX2 indicates that the function of the PROTX2 is important for oncogenesis.
Our results indicate that PROTX2 are important for regulating the cell cycle and that active transcriptional repression by PROTX1 may involve the modification of chromatin structure.
PROTX1[PROTX1 (PROTX1 / PROTX1)] mediates endothelial cell mitogenesis and permeability increases, whereas the role of PROTX2 [PROTX2 (PROTX2)] has not been clearly defined.
We have found that irradiation results in an up -  regulation of cellular levels of PROTX1, but not PROTX2, and that this enhanced level of PROTX1 accumulates within the nucleus.

We have identified a novel interaction of this receptor with the POU transcription factors PROTX1 and PROTX2 which was independent of ligand binding.
The expression of one transforming (PROTX1) and one non - transforming (PROTX2) Wnt gene in four human bladder carcinoma cell lines, and in normal human bladder tissues (n = 8) and bladder cancers (n = 48) were analysed by ribonuclease protection analysis.
PROTX2 and PROTX1 mRNAs were both expressed in normal bladder tissues and bladder tumours.
Some (PROTX1 and PROTX2) are more highly expressed in human breast cancer compared to normal tissues.
Factors regulating PROTX1 expression in human breast epithelium are poorly understood, but PROTX2 is amplified in many breast cancers and associated with rapid growth and metastasis, as is high expression of PROTX0.

Neither PROTX1 nor PROTX2 activity was purified during affinity chromatography of extract from EM9 cells transfected with pcD2EX, a cDNA minigene that encodes untagged PROTX1, or extract from wild - type AA8 or untransfected EM9 cells.
To determine whether PROTX1 is an essential regulator of the intrinsic pathway modulating terminal mitosis we examined the terminal differentiation of primary cortical progenitor cells and PROTX2 - dependent neural stem cells derived from PROTX1 - deficient mice.
This suggests that PROTX2 may partially compensate for the loss of PROTX1 in neural precursor cells.

The presence of PROTX1 and PROTX2 in differentiating villus enterocytes emphasizes that these cells retain part of their proliferative heritage expressed 24 - 72 h earlier in the crypt.
The data suggest that down - regulation of PROTX2 and / or PROTX1 expression may be important for control of proliferative status and / or execution of terminal differentiation.
The human PROTX1 gene consists of three coding exons and it maps to chromosome 10q24.1; human PROTX2 maps to 4q31.3.

The PROTX1 - related protein, PROTX2, has been shown to block apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli and to be a stronger protector against apoptosis than PROTX1 under certain circumstances.
Using site - specific mutagenesis, we show here that the amino - acid residues critical for protection of cells by PROTX2 against Sindbis virus - induced apoptosis are clustered within the PROTX1 - homology regions 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2 regions).
The residues necessary for PROTX2 function are not identical to those required for PROTX1 function.
Furthermore, loss of PROTX2 reduces a previously reported strain - dependent difference in PROTX0(+ /  - ) lifespan, suggesting that PROTX2 or an PROTX1 - regulated gene acts as a genetic modifier between the 129 / Sv and C57BL / 6 strains.

Expression and activation of chimeras formed between PROTX1 and PROTX2 in fibroblasts has allowed us to localize a major domain of PROTX1 responsible for adipogenesis to the N - terminal 138 amino acids, a region with AF - 1 transcriptional activity.
Ectopic expression of PROTX2 in preadipocytes containing endogenous PROTX1 causes a dramatic increase in fat cell differentiation at both the morphological and molecular levels.
This observation suggests that PROTX1 is a serious candidate for studying the cellular signaling pathway(s) involving PROTX2 in the presence of immunosuppressant drugs.
The kinetochore binding domain was used in a yeast two - hybrid screen to isolate interacting proteins that included the kinetochore proteins PROTX1, PROTX2, and PROTX0, a BUB1 - related kinase that was found to be mutated in some colorectal carcinomas (Cahill, D.P., C.

However, we find that loss of PROTX1 or PROTX2 does not reduce the association of PROTX0 with peroxisomes, demonstrating that these peroxins are not required for receptor docking.
These and other results lead us to propose that PROTX1 and PROTX2 play direct roles in peroxisomal matrix protein import downstream of the receptor docking event.
Immunofluorescence studies revealed that PROTX1 and PROTX2 colocalize to the nucleolus, and immunogold labeling further resolved the location of PROTX2 to the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus.
The Leu - Pro substitutions prevent interaction with PROTX1 (PROTX1), whose putative function in PROTX2 signaling we have previously disproved; the charge substitution at Thr204 constitutively activates TbetaR - I.
PROTX1, an antiapoptotic PROTX2 family member, is postulated to function at multiple stages in the cell death pathway.
We next sought to gain insights into the PROTX1 amino acid sequences required for the interaction between PROTX2 and PROTX0.

Previous studies of truncated human PROTX2 proteins indicated that the carboxyl terminus of human PROTX1 (amino acids 4330 - 4397) is important for Lp(a) assembly.
To determine whether the carboxyl terminus of mouse PROTX1 can interact with PROTX2, transgenic mice were produced with a mutant human PROTX0 gene construct in which human PROTX1 amino acids 4279 - 4536 were replaced with the corresponding mouse PROTX1 sequences and tyrosine 4326 was changed to a cysteine.

The fact that Lp(a) assembly was less efficient with the mouse PROTX2 sequences provides additional support for the notion that sequences in the carboxyl terminus of PROTX1 are important for Lp(a) assembly.
Though increases in PROTX2 protein by DNA damage were not abrogated by PROTX1 overexpression, increased levels of PROTX1, resulting either from endogenous gene amplification or from transfection of an exogenous expression vector, were associated with a reduction in the ability of cells to arrest in G1 following irradiation.
We show here that human PROTX1 is phosphorylated by the PROTX2 cyclin - dependent kinase in a ligand - dependent manner.
The enzyme is highly expressed in the thymus relative to other tissues and may play an important role in the T cell depletion associated with PROTX1 and PROTX2 deficiencies.
MLTF / USF activates transcription through the E box, whereas PROTX1 activates through the PROTX1 site, but binds weakly to this site in vitro and does not appear to mediate cell cycle - specific expression of PROTX2 in vivo.
Adenovirus PROTX1 19 - kDa protein (19K) is a member of the PROTX2 family of suppressors of apoptosis.
Here, we show that the analogous mutation in BH1 of 19K also abrogates the anti - apoptotic properties of 19K and its ability to interact with PROTX1, thus establishing the critical importance of this residue within BH1 and the likely similarity of PROTX2 and 19K function.
When expressed in endocrine cells or fibroblasts, PROTX1 is distributed in a punctate pattern in the perinuclear area but does not significantly overlap the distribution of transfected wild type PROTX2.
The distribution of PROTX1 displays significant overlap with the distribution of the secretory carrier membrane proteins, internalized Texas Red - conjugated transferrin, and PROTX2.

We tested nine amino acid residues (Ser(235), Ile(242), Lys(246), Asp(253), Ile(260), Leu(263), Leu(417), Leu(419), and Glu(420)) in human PROTX1 which, based on homology to the human PROTX2, would be predicted to lie in or near the coactivator - binding site.
This region of the PROTX2 promoter contains a CAGA motif also found in the promoter of the PROTX1.
Substitutions disrupting this sequence decreased the binding of nuclear extracts or recombinant PROTX1 to the CAGACA oligonucleotide, and markedly reduced the transcriptional response to PROTX2 or overexpressed PROTX1 in transient transfection assays.

Binding of PROTX1 to PROTX2 required the presence of the intact C terminus of PROTX2 ,  which represents a classical type II PDZ domain - binding motif.
Although PROTX1 did not interact with the single PDZ domains of PROTX2 or of PROTX0 ,  we found that a PROTX2 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to PROTX1 in vitro in a PDZ domain - dependent manner.

In human atherosclerotic lesions ,  however ,  PROTX1 expression correlated inversely with immunoreactive PROTX2 ,  supporting a potential role of the endogenous PROTX0 inhibitor in this chronic inflammatory disease.
Furthermore ,  PROTX1 antisense oligonucleotides coordinately reduced PROTX1 expression and promoted PROTX2 release.

PROTX0 ( PROTX0 ,  PROTX1 )  regulates key steps in inflammation and immunity ,  by activating the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL -  ) 1beta and PROTX2 ,  or mediating apoptotic processes.
Given these results ,  we discuss how PROTX1 regulates PROTX2 at the first step of translation initiation.
This suggests that the regulation of PROTX2 by PROTX1 phosphorylation is performed at its free state ,  not when it is in the associated state with PROTX2.
However ,  phosphorylation of PROTX2 already associated with PROTX1 or its m7GTP complex did not cause any change of the association ,  probably because of incomplete phosphorylation.
On the other hand ,  phosphorylation of PROTX2 weakened its interaction with PROTX1 whether m7GTP was present or not.
The association rate of PROTX2 with PROTX1 increased by about two orders of magnitude in the presence of m7GTP (a model compound of mRNA cap structure )  ,  but the dissociation rate was scarcely affected ,  indicating the cap - dependent binding of PROTX2 to PROTX1.
Together ,  these results indicate that PROTX1 can potentially modulate the functions ascribed to PROTX2 in transcriptional regulation ,  DNA repair ,  and / or cell cycle checkpoint control.
Finally ,  the interaction between PROTX1 and PROTX2 is shown to be stable in the face of genotoxic stress elicited by treatment with UV light ,  adriamycin ,  or hydrogen peroxide.

Sequence - specific transcriptional activators ,  such as the human factor PROTX1 ,  increase the rate of initiation of transcription by PROTX2 ,  possibly by contacting one or more of the PROTX2 - associated general initiation factors.
Previous studies using affinity chromatography techniques have shown that the activation domains of certain activators ,  including the acidic activation domain of PROTX1 ,  can interact with PROTX2 in the absence of DNA.
Using a site - directed photoaffinity cross - linking approach ,  we demonstrate here that the activation domain of the chimeric activator PROTX0 -  PROTX1 can be cross - linked to PROTX2 when both factors are bound to a transcriptionally responsive PROTX0 promoter.

Furthermore ,  intracellular forms of PROTX1(661 )  were found to bind PROTX2 with greater affinity than the extracellular forms.
Together ,  these data indicate that proper folding of PROTX1 is important for its interaction with PROTX2 and that modifications of glycans can modulate this interaction.
PROTX1 stimulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV - 1 )  transcription requires PROTX1 - dependent recruitment of human PROTX0 ( PROTX0 )  to the HIV - 1 promoter and the formation on the trans - acting response element (TAR )  RNA of a PROTX2 -  PROTX1 - TAR ternary complex.
Autophosphorylation of PROTX1 overcomes this inhibition by inducing conformational changes in PROTX0 ,  thereby exposing a region in PROTX2 for possible TAR binding.
This inhibition is relieved by the binding of the C - terminal region of PROTX1 to the transcription elongation factor PROTX2 -  PROTX0 and perhaps other cellular factors.
Upon release from the intramolecular interaction ,  the C - terminal region also interacts with PROTX0 and is required for HIV - 1 transcription ,  suggesting its role in bridging the PROTX1 -  PROTX2 - TAR complex and the basal elongation apparatus.
The importance of PROTX1 for PROTX2 gene expression is evident in murine erythroleukemia cells lacking the p45 subunit of PROTX1.
These CB3 cells have a severe defect in alpha -  and PROTX2 gene transcription ,  which can be restored by expression of PROTX1.
Thus ,  either a redundant factor(s )  exists in mice that can functionally replace PROTX1 ,  or PROTX1 does not function through the LCR to regulate PROTX2 gene expression.
These results support a direct role for PROTX1 in the regulation of PROTX2 gene expression through activation of the LCR.
Ample data exist contending that wild - type PROTX1 and PROTX2 cooperate to mediate apoptosis ,  that PROTX2 - mediated apoptosis is PROTX1 dependent in some situations ,  and that PROTX2 can induce accumulation of PROTX1 in mammalian cells.
To explain our growth assay findings on the basis of potential negative molecular interactions between PROTX0 and PROTX1 ,  Western and Northern blotting analyses were performed to investigate the differential expression of the downstream PROTX1 - transactivated genes ,  PROTX2 and PROTX0 ,  under various PROTX1 and PROTX0 gene transfer conditions.

Our in vitro data demonstrated that in SCCHN ,  PROTX1 interferes with induction of PROTX2 - transactivated genes ,  probably through the formation of protein - protein complexes.
PROTX2 and its counter - receptor PROTX2 ligand ( PROTX1 )  are members of the PROTX0 /  PROTX0 superfamily and function to regulate lymphocyte survival and differentiation.
Using a soluble PROTX1 /  PROTX0 chimeric protein ,  we assessed the ability of anti -  PROTX2 MAb to inhibit the binding of PROTX1 to PROTX2 expressed by the PROTX2+ Karpas 299 cell line.
PROTX1 binding by PROTX2 is blocked by MAb that recognize epitopes belonging to cluster Group A (like Ber - H2 ,  Ber - H8 ,  and HRS - 4 )  as well as cluster Group C (like HeFi - 1 and M44 ) .
Cluster Group B antibodies ,  including M67 and Ki - 1 ,  do not affect PROTX1 binding to PROTX2.
The pattern of PROTX1 binding inhibition shows only limited correspondence to the functional capacity of some anti -  PROTX2 MAb to trigger PROTX2 signaling.
Finally ,  we demonstrate that the anti -  PROTX1 MAb M81 also completely inhibits PROTX2 /  PROTX1 interaction.
This information is useful for applying these MAbs in functional studies to further investigate the PROTX2 /  PROTX1 system and for designing assays for soluble PROTX1.
The PROTX2 gene product induces cell cycle arrest in PROTX1 - null human leukemic cells exposed to differentiation stimuli.
These observations indicate that dysregulation of PROTX1 in PROTX2 - null human myeloid leukemia cells interferes with PMA - related G1 arrest ,  PROTX0 inhibition ,  differentiation ,  and loss of clonogenic survival in the absence of obvious alterations in PROTX0 phosphorylation status or PROTX0 complex formation.

In eukaryotes ,  apart from catalyzing the translation termination reaction ,  PROTX1 binds to and activates another factor ,  PROTX2 ,  which is a ribosome - dependent and PROTX1 - dependent GTPase.
The C - terminal one - third of PROTX1 binds to PROTX2 in vivo in the absence of the core domain ,  but both domains are required to activate PROTX2 GTPase in the ribosome.
This highly uneven charge distribution between the two domains implies that electrostatic interdomain interaction may affect the PROTX1 binding to the ribosome and PROTX2 ,  its activity in the termination reaction and activation of PROTX2 GTPase.
The structural and functional dissimilarity of the core and PROTX2 - binding domains implies that evolutionarily PROTX1 originated as a product of gene fusion.

Based on observations that in some CLL cases ,  the tumor cells express both PROTX2 and its ligand ,  PROTX1 ( PROTX2 ligand )  ,  we proposed a model for CLL pathogenesis due to PROTX2 ligation within the tumor.
In each case examined ,  PROTX1 ligation further augmented PROTX2 activity and prolonged CLL cell survival in vitro.

In a PROTX1 - positive case ,  blocking PROTX1 engagement by mAb to PROTX1 resulted in inhibition of PROTX2 activity in the CLL cells.
These data indicate that PROTX1 engagement has a profound influence on PROTX2 activity and survival in CLL B cells ,  and are consistent with a role for PROTX0 - expressing T and B cells in CLL pathogenesis.
The data support the development of novel therapies based on blocking the PROTX1 -  PROTX2 interaction in CLL.
In this study ,  we demonstrate that the bZIP transcriptional factor PROTX1 is able to bind in vitro to the TxREs and that PROTX1 binding to each of the 21 - bp motifs is enhanced by PROTX2.

Mutagenesis of PROTX1 and PROTX2 demonstrates that both N -  and C - terminal domains of PROTX1 and the C - terminal region of PROTX2 are required for direct interaction between the two proteins.
In addition ,  the PROTX1 mutant M47 ,  defective for HTLV - 1 activation ,  is unable to form in vitro a ternary complex with PROTX2 and TxRE.

Taken together ,  our data highlight the major role played by PROTX2 in PROTX1 - mediated transactivation.
In human lymphoid leukemic cells ,  ET - 18 - OCH(3 )  does not promote PROTX2 or PROTX1 expression and ET - 18 - OCH(3 )  - induced apoptosis is not inhibited by pre - incubation with an anti -  PROTX2 blocking antibody that abrogates cell killing mediated by PROTX2 /  PROTX1 interactions.
Our data indicate that ET - 18 - OCH(3 )  induces apoptosis via PROTX2 after the ether lipid is inside the cell ,  and this PROTX2 activation is independent of the interaction of PROTX2 with its natural ligand PROTX1.
Members of the PROTX1 of transcription factors have been implicated in the transduction of PROTX2 signals.

Interleukin - 1beta - converting enzyme ( PROTX2 )  inhibitors do not prevent the recovery of PROTX1 bioactivity after allorecognition ,  indicating that allospecific PROTX0(+ )  T cells may induce the release of bioactive PROTX1 via mechanism(s )  other than PROTX2 activation.

PROTX1 binds to PROTX2 and stimulates its nuclease activity ,  but the physiological significance of this interaction is unknown.
In a reconstituted BER assay system containing PROTX2 ,  omission of PROTX1 caused the accumulation of pre - excision reaction intermediates which could be converted to completely repaired product by addition of PROTX1.
In contrast ,  a PROTX1 mutant that could not bind to PROTX2 was unable to stimulate excision.
To further study this effect ,  a mutant of PROTX2 was identified that retained full nuclease activity but was specifically defective in binding to PROTX1.
These results indicate that PROTX1 facilitates excision during long - patch BER through its interaction with PROTX2.
An effector of intercellular adhesion ,  PROTX1 also functions in PROTX0 signaling ,  associating with PROTX2 DNA - binding proteins to form a transcription factor.

The effect of PROTX1 on PROTX2 transcription appeared to be due ,  in part ,  to its intrinsic acetyltransferase activity ,  as stimulation induced by a histone acetyltransferase - deficient mutant PROTX1 was substantially reduced.

Introduction of ectopic wt PROTX1 had no effect on PTX sensitivity in both parental and resistant cells ,  while it induced PROTX2 ,  demonstrating an intact PROTX1 pathway.
Further ,  lithium which inhibits the cytoplasmic kinase PROTX1 and hence influences PROTX2 levels did cause differentiation of NTERA2 cells.
Previous studies had demonstrated that MG - 63 cells express the PROTX1 and that 1 , 25(OH ) (2 ) D(3 )  regulates expression of PROTX0 ( PROTX2 ) .
Whereas 10( - 8 )  M 1 , 25(OH ) (2 ) D(3 )  produced a 3.6 - fold stimulation in PROTX2 in mock cells expressing normal levels of PROTX1 ,  it did not alter PROTX2 in cells expressing reduced levels of PROTX1.
Thus ,  PROTX1 is required for 1 , 25(OH ) (2 ) D(3 )  - mediated gene expression of PROTX2 by human MG - 63 cells.
PROTX1 - mediated cell adhesion is also involved in the change in MMP level ,  since blockade of PROTX1 subunits (alpha1 ,  alpha3 ,  alpha5 ,  and beta1 )  on T cells resulted in less astrocytic PROTX2 - induced expression.

In attempt to shed light on PROTX1 function ,  we have identified a novel coiled - coil protein ,  PROTX2 ,  that specifically associates with PROTX1 in vitro and in vivo.
Surprisingly ,  immunoprecipitation assays reveal that in a cellular context ,  association with PROTX2 can be observed only with some naturally occurring mutants of PROTX1 ,  or a PROTX1 spliced isoform lacking exons 2 and 3 ,  but not with the PROTX1 isoform exhibiting growth - suppressive activity.
Our observations suggest that PROTX2 interaction with PROTX1 is regulated by conformational changes in PROTX1 ,  possibly induced by posttranslational modifications ,  alternative splicing ,  or mutations.
Association of the PROTX1 protein with the DNA repair protein PROTX2 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to DNA - damaging agents are consistent with a role for PROTX1 in DNA repair.
Indeed ,  PROTX1 ( PROTX1 )  ,  one of the main monocyte - derived cytokines ,  upregulated PROTX2 mRNA levels in cultured human mesangial cells in a time - dependent manner.
It has recently been demonstrated that PROTX1 interacts with and is catalytically stimulated by the PROTX2 protein [2 , 3] ,  which is essential for DNA double - strand break repair and the genomic rearrangement process of V(D ) J recombination [4].
It has been suggested that PROTX1 associates with PROTX2 via its tandem BRCT domains and that this may be a general model for protein - protein interactions between DNA repair proteins [3].
We have performed a detailed deletional analysis of PROTX1 to define its PROTX2 - binding domain and to characterize regions essential for its catalytic activity.
We find that a region in the carboxy - terminal tail of PROTX1 located between rather than within BRCT domains is necessary and sufficient to confer binding to PROTX2.
Here ,  we identify the PROTX1 transcription factor as a direct mediator of PROTX0 activation in primary human fibroblasts through its ability to specifically induce PROTX2 gene expression.

Through the use of a hormone inducible form of PROTX1 ( PROTX1 - ER )  ,  we demonstrate that PROTX0 - induced activation of the PROTX2 promoter requires an evolutionarily conserved E - box and that PROTX1 - ER - induced accumulation of PROTX2 mRNA takes place in the absence of de novo protein synthesis.
Inhibition of PROTX1 results in immediate deprotection of chromosome ends ,  manifested by loss of the telomeric 3' overhang ,  activation of PROTX2 ,  and end - to - end chromosome fusions.

The PROTX1 repressor appeared to be the PROTX0 PROTX2 ,  which bound the PROTX0 - repressible E - boxes of the PROTX1 promoter.

Formation of the initiation complex is dependent on ATP hydrolysis and at least functional PROTX1 and PROTX2 proteins ,  because the complex could not be detected in tumor cells that produce truncated PROTX2 or PROTX1 protein.
While PROTX1 expression decreased ,  constitutive expression of PROTX2 and PROTX0 increased.
While PROTX1 expression decreased ,  constitutive expression of PROTX0 and PROTX2 increased.
Irradiated PROTX1 -  attenuated cells failed to induce PROTX2 ,  demonstrated radioresistant DNA synthesis ,  and increased radiosensitivity.
The crystal structure of the human PROTX1 processivity factor PROTX2 ( PROTX0 )  complexed with a 22 residue peptide derived from the C - terminus of the cell - cycle checkpoint protein p21(WAF1 / CIP1 )  has been determined at 2.6 angstrom resolution.
An intact trimeric ring is maintained in the structure of the PROTX2 -  PROTX1 complex ,  with a central hole available for DNA interaction.
The ability of PROTX2 to inhibit the action of PROTX1 is therefore likely to be due to its masking of elements on PROTX1 that are required for the binding of other components of the polymerase assembly.
The only transcription factor that has so far been implicated in the regulation of PROTX1 expression is the PROTX2 oncoprotein.
Our analysis shows that another member of the myc / max / mad network ,  PROTX2 ,  encoding a transcriptional repressor that is significantly increased by 12 - O - tetra - decanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate treatment ,  represses PROTX1 promoter - driven reporter gene activity in transient transfection assays.
This effect is dependent on the NH2 terminal domain of PROTX2 ,  which mediates the association with the transcriptional corepressor PROTX1.
This protein ,  termed PROTX1 for PROTX0 ,  binds to a 17 - base pair (bp )  region of the PROTX2 promoter ,  which was shown earlier to participate in hypoxia - induced expression of the PROTX2 gene.
In Hep3B cells ,  clones modified to express PROTX1 antisense RNA showed an attenuated response to hypoxia - mediated induction of both PROTX2 and PROTX0 transcription.

Here we demonstrate that PROTX1 ,  a secreted mammalian (beta )  - galactoside binding protein ,  inhibits adhesion of human carcinoma (1299 )  cells to plates coated with PROTX2 ligands ,  and induces cell apoptosis.
Pretreatment of the cells with Mn(2+ )  ,  which increases the affinity of PROTX2s for their ligands ,  abolished the inhibitory effects of PROTX1.
PROTX1 also interacts with other members of the PROTX2 family ,  like (alpha ) (6 ) (beta ) (1  )  PROTX0s.
We propose that PROTX1 is an PROTX2 binding - protein that interacts to a different extent with several ,  but not all members of the PROTX2 family.
Binding of PROTX1 modulates PROTX2 interactions with the extracellular matrix and thus regulates cell adhesion and cell survival.
We show here that the ectopic expression of the PROTX0 catalytic subunit ( PROTX1 )  in combination with two oncogenes (the simian virus 40 PROTX2 oncoprotein and an oncogenic allele of PROTX0 )  results in direct tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells.

The protein - tyrosine phosphatase PROTX1 is a positive modulator of the PROTX0 / mitogen - activated protein kinase pathway and a putative substrate of the transforming non - receptor tyrosine kinase PROTX2.
Expression of PROTX1 was found to be necessary for morphological transformation by PROTX2: PROTX1+ / + cells became rounded or spindly upon PROTX2 expression ,  whereas PROTX1 - deficient cells remained relatively flat.
PROTX0 deficiency also reduced PROTX1 - induced activation of the anti - apoptotic protein kinase PROTX2.
PROTX1 deficiency also reduced PROTX2 - induced activation of the anti - apoptotic protein kinase PROTX0.
PROTX1 deficiency also reduced PROTX0 - induced activation of the anti - apoptotic protein kinase PROTX2.
PROTX0 deficiency also reduced PROTX1 - induced activation of the anti - apoptotic protein kinase PROTX2.
The reduced activation of PROTX2 in PROTX1 - deficient cells correlated with a reduction in the association of the PROTX0 with the adapter protein PROTX0.
Activation of PROTX2 by PROTX1 may be mediated by the association of the adapter protein PROTX0 with the PROTX0 subunit.

Inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( PROTX1 )  has been implicated in melanoma cells ,  but the molecular basis for this phenotype has not yet been elucidated ,  and the status of additional family members ( PROTX0 and PROTX0 ,  together termed pocket proteins )  or the consequences on downstream targets such as PROTX2 transcription factors are not known.
PROTX1 was the only family member more abundant in the melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes ,  and the approximately fivefold increase in DNA binding activity could be accounted for mostly by a similar increase in the levels of the dimerization partner PROTX2.
The continuous high expression of PROTX0 ,  A2 ,  and E ,  the persistent cyclin - dependent kinase 4 (CDK4 )  and CDK2 activities ,  and the presence of hyperphosphorylated forms of PROTX1 ,  PROTX0 ,  and PROTX0 ,  suggest that melanoma cells acquired the capacity for autonomous growth through inactivation of all three pocket proteins and release of PROTX2 activity ,  otherwise tightly regulated in normal melanocytes by external growth factors.

The multiplicity and invasiveness of intestinal adenomas of PROTX1(Min / + )  (Min )  mice was enhanced by deficiency for PROTX2.
The genetic modifier PROTX1 and the pharmacological agents piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine each reduced intestinal adenoma multiplicity in the absence of PROTX2 function.
This effect is blocked by the PROTX1 antagonist ,  PROTX2 ,  and mimicked by PROTX1 - 7a ,  which is expressed by granule cells.
PROTX1 also induces PROTX2 clustering at remodeled areas of mossy fibers ,  a preliminary step in synaptogenesis.
PROTX1 mutant mice show a delay in the morphological maturation of glomerular rosettes and in the accumulation of PROTX2.
We have investigated the regulation of PROTX1's transcriptional activity by PROTX0 /  PROTX0 ( PROTX2 ) .

The N terminus but not the N - terminal truncation of PROTX1 bound to the CH1 domain (amino acids [aa] 350 to 450 )  of PROTX2 /  PROTX0.

PROTX1 - dependent transcription or apoptosis was partially impaired in either PROTX2 -  or PROTX0 - deficient human breast carcinoma MCF - 7 or H1299 cells ,  suggesting that both coactivators mediate transcription by PROTX1 in cells.

Since a kinase - negative mutant of PROTX1 prevents promoter activation ,  it appears that transcriptional activation of the PROTX2 gene requires an active PROTX1 kinase tethered to its promoter region.
Moreover ,  it appears that PROTX1 also suppresses RNA PROTX2 transcription.
We show that wild - type ,  but not mutant ,  PROTX1 can repress PROTX2 transcription from a human rRNA gene promoter in cotransfection assays.
In agreement with these results ,  PROTX1 - null epithelial cells display an increased PROTX2 transcriptional activity compared to that of epithelial cells that express PROTX1.

PROTX1 binds to DNA as homodimers or as heterodimers in association with a protein ,  PROTX2 (for PROTX0 ) .
PROTX1 -  PROTX0 heterodimers bind more efficiently than homodimers to DNA ,  PROTX0 as well as the adenovirus PROTX0 protein and PROTX2 can stimulate transcription from PROTX1 sites in a synergistic fashion.
Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel human DP gene ,  PROTX2 ,  whose product dimerizes efficiently with PROTX1.
We believe that PROTX2 also plays a major role in modulating the function of PROTX1 in cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis.
PROTX0 ( PROTX1 )  is a processivity factor required for PROTX2 (or epsilon )  - catalyzed DNA synthesis.

These results are in keeping with a model in which surface exposed regions of PROTX2 interact with PROTX1 and the subsequent loading of PROTX2 onto DNA orients the elongation complex in a manner essential for processive DNA synthesis.

We hypothesize that because of functional mutations in cell - cycle regulatory genes (e.g., PROTX1 and / or PROTX2), cells lose the ability to maintain a pattern of gene expression mechanistically associated with normal, division - limited homeostatic equilibrium.
Because the PROTX1 x PROTX2 / PROTX0 gene expression index has high specificity for malignant tissue, it will allow confirmation that there is a significant amount of tumor tissue present in small (e.g., fine - needle) biopsy specimens prior to evaluating them for expression of other genes, such as those involved in chemoresistance or radioresistance.

Polyoma tumor - derived cells in culture retained PROTX1, and most of these showed induction of PROTX2 in response to DNA damage.

Three alternatively spliced PROTX1 transcripts were detected in all PROTX2 - positive samples, whereas neither variant could be detected in the MCCs.
These results indicate that PROTX1 expression is rate - limiting for human PROTX2 activity and that re - activation, rather than up - regulation, of PROTX1 expression can play a critical role in MM carcinogenesis.
While waiting suitable anti - PROTX1 antibodies, these results provide information for the design of PROTX1 mRNA - specific in situ probes to study PROTX2 in archived pre - malignant serosal lesions.
PROTX2 and PROTX1 were separated from the other BER proteins by fractionation of human whole - cell extract on a phosphocellulose column.
Purified PROTX2 or PROTX1, when added separately, could only partially restore the PC - FII repair activity of AP sites.
Promoter activity for the proliferation - associated genes, PROTX1 and PROTX2, are inhibited during squamous differentiation.
On the basis of these data and the relative sensitivity of bleomycin - induced repair synthesis to N2 - (p - n - butylphenyl) - 2' - deoxyguanosine 5' - triphosphate (BuPdGTP), 2',3' - dideoxythymidine 5' - triphosphate (ddTTP), and N - ethylmaleimide (NEM), long - patch repair is attributed to PROTX1 and short - patch repair to PROTX2.
By crossing mice that carry a null allele of PROTX1 with transgenic mice that develop mammary adenocarcinomas under the influence of a PROTX2 transgene, we have studied the consequences of PROTX1 deficiency in mammary gland neoplasia.

Recently, it has been shown that PROTX0 is much more sensitive to inhibition by the nucleotide analogue 2',3' - dideoxythymidine 5' - triphosphate (ddTTP) than PROTX1 but is less sensitive than PROTX2 [Wahl, A.F., Crute, J.J., Sabatino, R.D., Bodner, J.B., Marraccino, R.L., Harwell, L.W., Lord, E.M., & Bambara, R.A.

We find that DNA replication and ultraviolet - induced DNA repair synthesis in permeable human fibroblasts are also more sensitive to inhibition by ddTTP than PROTX1 and less sensitive than PROTX2.
These are both much less than the Ki of PROTX1 (which is greater than 200 microM) but greater than the Ki of PROTX2 (which is less than 2 microM).
In permeable cells, the process was further analyzed by using the nucleotide analogue (butylphenyl) - 2' - deoxyguanosine 5' - triphosphate, which inhibits PROTX1 several hundred times more strongly than it inhibits PROTX2.
In this work, Jurkat T - lymphoblastoid cells that express PROTX1 were characterized by the use of transiently transfected PROTX2 and PROTX2 reporter genes.
Dexamethasone also increased the cytosolic amounts of the PROTX1 and the PROTX2 inhibitor proteins in L6 cells.
Mice deficient for both PROTX1 and PROTX2 have a marked deficiency in trunk neural crest derivatives including NC - Ms.
Transgenic mice with tva in either PROTX1 - expressing neural precursor cells (line Ntva) or PROTX2 (PROTX2) - expressing melanoblasts (line DCTtva) were analyzed.
We overstimulated Wnt signaling in two ways: directed gene transfer of PROTX1 to Ntva(+) cells and transfer of PROTX2 to DCTtva(+) NC - M precursor cells.
Human herpesvirus - 8 (HHV - 8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma - associated herpesvirus, encodes a protein, referred to as HHV8 - PROTX1, with sequence similarity to human PROTX2, in particular of the D type.
Moreover, inappropriate reactivation of this pathway attributable to PROTX1 or PROTX2 mutations has been described in colorectal cancers.
Thus, loss of the PROTX1 capacity to interact with COOH - terminal binding protein could be an important event during colorectal carcinogenesis by modifying PROTX2 signaling.

In order to shed some light on this issue, we analysed the localisation of two proteins that are involved in early steps of meiotic recombination, PROTX1 and PROTX2, relative to AEs and SCs by immunofluorescence labelling of paraffin sections of the mouse testis, using affinity -  purified polyclonal antibodies against PROTX1 and PROTX2, and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SC components.
The localisation patterns of PROTX2 and PROTX1 within spermatocytes were very similar.
PROTX2 and PROTX1 appeared in high abundance in preleptotene spermatocytes, just before SC components could be detected.
In mid and late zygotene, PROTX2 and PROTX1 concentrated in distinct areas; in early pachytene the two proteins had almost disappeared from the nucleus, except from the sex vesicle (the chromatin of the XY bivalent), where they persisted in high abundance until diplotene.
We propose that PROTX2 and PROTX1, together with other proteins, prepare chromatin throughout the early meiotic prophase nucleus for the initiation of meiotic recombination.
Possibly, only a small fraction of the PROTX1 -  and PROTX2 - containing (pre)recombination complexes associates transiently with AEs, where further steps in meiotic recombination can take place.
This implies that PROTX1 is a novel mutation target of microsatellite instability where abnormal transcripts are generated indirectly by intronic mutations, which is distinct from the other mutation targets such as the PROTX2 gene or PROTX0, where exonic repeats are directly affected.

No evidence for PROTX2 interaction with the PROTX1 intermembrane space domain was obtained.
Moreover, the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases PROTX1 and PROTX2.
No correlation was evident between overexpression of PROTX1 and reduced PROTX2(PROTX2) expression.
The expression of PROTX1 in human colorectal carcinomas was examined immunohistochemically, and the correlation of PROTX1 expression with clinicopathological findings and with the expression of PROTX2(PROTX2) was analyzed to elucidate the role of PROTX1 in the development and progression of colorectal carcinomas.

Activation of PROTX1 and PROTX2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis.
These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of PROTX0 by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of PROTX0(PROTX0) expression and the increase in PROTX1 and PROTX2 kinase activities.

The changes in PROTX1 and PROTX2 protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug - treated A253 cells.
Twenty - four hours following the initial 2 - h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing PROTX1 and PROTX2(PROTX2), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2 / M phases.
Furthermore, the dominant - negative form of PROTX1 completely blocked B6H12 - induced morphologic and functional changes without inhibiting phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate - induced spreading on FN in BALL cells, whereas the dominant - negative form of PROTX2 inhibited all these changes.

Biochemical analyses of these mutant PROTX2,6,7 complexes indicated that the ATP binding activity of the PROTX1 protein in the complex is critical for DNA helicase activity and that the PROTX2 protein may play a role in the single - stranded DNA binding activity of the complex.
In this study, we have expressed and isolated the mouse PROTX1, 4,6,7 proteins from insect cells and characterized various mutant PROTX0,6,7 complexes in which the conserved ATPase motifs of the PROTX0 and PROTX2 proteins were mutated.

At the protein level, PROTX1 expression varies with cell cycle progression in a pattern identical to that of PROTX2.
In contrast to PROTX2, however, the G(1) / S induction of PROTX1 expression is mediated primarily by post - transcriptional mechanisms.
To understand the functions of PROTX1, we have evaluated its biological properties with respect to those of PROTX2.
Sequence comparisons and chromosomal localization strongly suggest that PROTX1, rather than PROTX2, is the mouse orthologue of both the human PROTX0 and Xenopus PROTX0 genes.

By contrast, C5adesarg, lacking the C - terminal arginine, induces minimal lipid mediator formation but is fully active to induce PROTX1 production and is even a superagonist for PROTX2 release.
Levels of pocket protein PROTX1 persisted, whereas PROTX2 did not accumulate.
In addition, levels of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors, PROTX1 and PROTX2, were not affected by HSV - 1.
Previous experiments demonstrated that in asynchronous infected cells, hypophosphorylated PROTX1 and pocket protein - PROTX2 complexes accumulated, and cellular DNA synthesis was rapidly inhibited.
PROTX2 had little effect on this coupled reaction, but did inhibit the subsequent elongation of products, presumably after PROTX1 dissociated from the 3' - end of the DNA fragments.
These encode the human transcription factor PROTX1 and the dominant - negative helix - loop - helix gene PROTX2, respectively.
Two series of peptides that specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the PROTX1 (PROTX1), but share no primary sequence homology to PROTX2, were identified from libraries of random recombinant peptides.
Furthermore, the dimer peptide, but not PROTX0, can activate a chimeric receptor consisting of the PROTX1 extracellular domain fused to the intracellular domain of the PROTX2 receptor, thus demonstrating that the peptide also promotes receptor dimerization in a cellular context.

Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induced an association between centromeres and ND10 proteins PROTX1 and PROTX2 in a significant number of cells in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle.
The carboxyl terminus of PROTX1 has extensive homology to a mammalian protein called PROTX2 (PROTX2), but unlike PROTX2, which is secreted, PROTX1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
PROTX1 has several novel putative protein - protein interaction motifs, as well as a PDZ domain and a PROTX2 homology 3 - binding domain.
The third, PROTX2, is a factor which is required, with PROTX1, for coordinated leading -  and lagging - strand synthesis at the replication fork.
We find this requires PROTX1, because RB( -  /  - ) fibroblasts are significantly less sensitive to excess PROTX2(E4F).
To characterize the role of PROTX1 in apoptosis, we examined endogenous retinoblastoma gene (Rb) expression following treatment with PROTX2, okadaic acid, or antisense Rb S - oligonucleotides in cultured primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma HuH - 7 cells.
Two nuclear factors, PROTX1 and PROTX2, interact with the hypersensitive site.
Exogenous expression of PROTX1, the catalytic component of PROTX2, is sufficient for the immortalization of human fibroblasts but insufficient for the immortalization of human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).
Of five PROTX1 - immortalized HFK and HAK cell lines examined, four exhibited repression of PROTX2 expression by promoter methylation or specific large - scale deletion of chromosome 9p, the location of PROTX2.
Interestingly, one cell line exhibited complete down - regulation of expression of PROTX1, with only slight down - regulation of expression of PROTX2.
Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy showed that PROTX1 localizes in distinct punctate nuclear regions and colocalizes with PROTX2.
Functional analysis was performed by cotransfection assays: PROTX1 acted as a transcriptional repressor, whereas its partner PROTX2 behaved as a transcriptional activator.
In an effort to isolate novel growth factors, we identified a human protein, designated PROTX1, that co - eluted with PROTX2 during chromatographic separation of conditioned medium from the SK - LMS - 1 human leiomyosarcoma cell line.
PROTX1 and PROTX2 are related chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans which are mainly expressed in the central nervous system.
PROTX1 and the secreted PROTX2 variant are composed of globular N - terminal hyaluronan binding domains, central O - linked oligosaccharide attachment regions, and globular C - terminal domains.
Interaction studies of mouse brain proteoglycans revealed that PROTX1, but not PROTX2, was retained on a heparin affinity matrix.
We investigated the effect of oxalomalate (OMA, alpha - hydroxy - beta - oxalosuccinic acid), a competitive inhibitor of PROTX0, on the RNA - binding activity of the iron - regulatory proteins (PROTX1 and PROTX2) that control the post - transcriptional expression of various proteins involved in iron metabolism.

OMA remarkably decreased the binding activity of PROTX1 and, when present, of PROTX2, in all samples analysed.
Northern blot analysis did not indicate that transcription of PROTX1, the catalytic subunit of PROTX0, or PROTX2, the RNA component, was elevated after irradiation.

We propose that preferential stimulation of valvular PROTX2 receptors by norfenfluramine, ergot drugs, or 5 - HT released from carcinoid tumors (with or without accompanying PROTX1 receptor activation) may contribute to valvular fibroplasia in humans.
We hope to be able to explore the role of this binding protein in the mammary gland with a transgenic mouse model expressing PROTX1 on the PROTX2 promoter.
One carcinoma and 2 cell lines exhibited amino acid changes in both the PROTX1 gene and in the mutation clustered region of the PROTX2 gene.
Mutations in the PROTX1 and PROTX2 genes account for 85 and 15% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively.
In this study, the cellular and subcellular distribution of PROTX2 is defined and compared with PROTX1.
Immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence microscopy localized PROTX2 to the basolateral plasma membrane of kidney tubular epithelial cells compared with the junctional localization of PROTX1.
Differences in the developmental, cellular, and subcellular expression of PROTX1 and PROTX2 suggest that they may be able to function independently of each other in addition to a potential in vivo interaction via their C - termini.
The first autoinhibition arises from the unphosphorylated state of PROTX1, which establishes a PROTX2 conformation unfavorable for TAR recognition.
An intramolecular interaction between the N -  and C - terminal regions of PROTX2 sterically blocks the PROTX1 - TAR interaction and constitutes the second autoinhibitory mechanism.
Mammalian cells possess two distinct pathways for completion of base excision repair (BER): the PROTX1 (PROTX2) - dependent short - patch pathway (replacement of one nucleotide), which is the main route, and the long - patch pathway (resynthesis of 2 - 6 nucleotides), which is PROTX0 - dependent

These DNA polymerases are also able to perform short - patch BER in the absence of PROTX2, although less efficiently than PROTX1.
Using three different Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) - deficient mouse strains, we examined the induction of autoimmune hemolytic anemia by each of the four immunoglobulin (Ig)G isotype - switch variants of a 4C8 IgM antierythrocyte autoantibody and its relation to the contributions of the two FcgammaR, PROTX1, and PROTX2, operative in the phagocytosis of opsonized particles.
We found that the four IgG isotypes of this antibody displayed striking differences in pathogenicity, which were related to their respective capacity to interact in vivo with the two phagocytic FcgammaRs, defined as follows: IgG2a > IgG2b > IgG3 / IgG1 for PROTX1, and IgG2a > IgG1 > IgG2b > IgG3 for PROTX2.
An unexpected critical role of the low - affinity PROTX2 was revealed by the use of two different IgG2a anti - red blood cell autoantibodies, which displayed a striking preferential utilization of PROTX2, compared with the high - affinity PROTX1.
These data support the investigation of the biological consequences of combined wild - type PROTX1 and PROTX2 overexpression in human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) for the purpose of developing apoptosis - inducing molecular intervention strategies for the management of this devastating disease.
The recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors Ad - PROTX1 and Ad - PROTX2 were used for wild - type PROTX1 and PROTX2 gene transfers, respectively, into SCCHN cell lines TU138 and TU167.
SCCHN cells transduced with either PROTX1, PROTX2, or both underwent in vitro growth analysis, which revealed that simultaneous PROTX1 and PROTX2 gene transfer did not result in enhanced growth inhibition.
Simultaneous PROTX1 and PROTX2 gene transfer is not therapeutically advantageous in this in vitro model of SCCHN.
Although HL - AS5 and HL - 60 / V2 cells did not exhibit obvious differences in the phosphorylation status of the PROTX1 (PROTX1), in PROTX2 complex formation, or in PROTX0 induction following PMA exposure, inhibition of activity of PROTX0 was attenuated in the antisense - expressing line.

Using an in vitro cell culture model, we found that epithelial cell monolayers released significant quantities of PROTX1 and expressed increased levels of PROTX2 mRNA and surface protein in response to H. influenzae.
In contrast, levels of PROTX1, PROTX2, and MHC class I were not significantly affected, suggesting preferential activation of a specific subset of epithelial genes directed toward defense against bacteria.
Direct induction of specific epithelial cell genes (such as PROTX2 and PROTX1) by bacterial infection may allow for rapid and efficient innate defense in the airway.

PROTX1 (PROTX1) is a catalytic subunit of human PROTX2 and is a critical determinant of the enzymatic activity of PROTX2.
Our findings revealed that (i) the binding of a specific nuclear factor to the enhancer element was very weak in senescent cells; (ii) the binding of a specific nuclear factor to the CRE, which is independent of cell growth, was unchanged between young and senescent cells; (iii) nuclear factors from senescent cells did not bind to the presumptive silencer element; (iv) the binding of specific factors to the Inr (transcription initiation region) and PROTX1 increased with growth stimulation in young cells and was weakly detectable in senescent cells; and (v) the binding of PROTX2 to its promoter element occurred only in senescent cells.
The short C - terminal stretch from Lys254 to Glu256 is necessary for stimulation of PROTX1 ATPase activity, but not for stimulation of DNA synthesis by PROTX2.
Several other charged amino acids are also required to stimulate either PROTX1 ATPase or PROTX2 DNA synthesis.
Transfection of serial deletion mutants indicated two positive regulatory regions within the promoter ( - 142 /  - 240 and  - 240 / 490) likely involved in binding PROTX1 and PROTX2 transcription factors.
However, targeted gene inactivations of PROTX1, PROTX2, or PROTX0 in the mouse do not produce phenotypes that mimic any known PROTX0 mutation.

The PROTX1 consensus binding sequence (PROTX2 promoter) and PROTX1 A,B antibody abolished or shifted CIII.
Although the PROTX1 consensus binding sequence (the PROTX2 promoter) eliminated all three complexes, the antibody to PROTX1 had no effect on all three complexes.
These results indicate that the CCAAT motif binds to PROTX1 and the CI / CII binding protein (remains to be identified) but not PROTX2 in endometrium.
PROTX2 in turn, is fused to PROTX1 in the t(10;11)(p11.2;q23) translocation.

The results support a role for PROTX2 and PROTX1 in the pathogenesis of late nasal response and show that decreases in PROTX2 expression parallel the reduction in PROTX1 expression that occurs with topical steroid treatment.
In this study we examined the PROTX1 status of three paclitaxel selected human ovarian carcinoma sublines, resistant to paclitaxel due to acquired PROTX2 mutations which impair paclitaxel's interaction with tubulin.
However, consideration of the phenotype of the resultant cells suggested that this effect may be because of lithium mimicking activation of a PROTX1 signalling pathway, rather than an effect on signalling consequent upon PROTX2 mediated cell to cell adhesion.
We determined the effect of normal and reduced PROTX2 expression in MG - 63 cells on 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) - mediated stimulation of PROTX1.
In the present study, we examined the expression of inflammatory mediators the cytokine - induced PROTX2 (PROTX1,  - 3, and  - 9) and their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of PROTX2 (PROTX0,  - 2, and  - 3), in human astrocytes in response to activated T cells.

To assess the involvement of the extracellular portion of PROTX1 in this process, we transfected a chimeric molecule (PROTX2 PROTX1) consisting of the extracellular portion of the PROTX2 (PROTX2), and of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of human PROTX1.
PROTX1 is characterized by a unique carboxy - terminal tail comprising two BRCT (PROTX2 carboxyl terminus) domains.
Human telomeres consist of long arrays of TTAGGG repeats bound to the telomere - specific proteins, PROTX1 and PROTX2.
Mammalian telomeres contain a duplex array of telomeric repeats bound to the telomeric repeat - binding factors PROTX1 and PROTX2.
In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that one of the isolated PROTX1 genes, PROTX2, is broadly expressed in the embryonic telencephalon.
By contrast, three others, PROTX1, 5a and a novel mouse PROTX2 gene, PROTX0, are expressed only at the medial edge of the telencephalon, defining the hem of the cerebral cortex.

In addition, although the cortical hem does not show features of differentiated CPe, such as expression of PROTX0 mRNA, the CPe and cortical hem are linked by shared expression of members of the PROTX1 and PROTX2 gene families.
We show that PROTX1 gene expression is deficient at the cortical hem in XtJ / XtJ mice, but that the expression of other telencephalic developmental control genes, including PROTX2, is maintained.
The rate - limiting step for PROTX1 activity seems to be the expression of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, encoded by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (PROTX2) gene.
Hypoxia is a strong stimulus for the transcription of a set of genes, including PROTX1 and PROTX2.

To characterize the role of PROTX1 in cellular transformation and signaling by PROTX2, we expressed PROTX2 in normal and PROTX1 - deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts.
The defect in activation of the PROTX1 survival pathway also correlated with enhanced sensitivity of PROTX2 - deficient cells to an apoptosis - inducing agent.
Using a combination of gene disruption and ectopic expression in growth factor - dependent mouse melanocytes, we studied the roles of PROTX1 and the PROTX2 and PROTX0 CKIs (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors) in the acquisition of TPA (12 - O - tetradecanoyl phorbol - 13 - acetate) - independent growth in culture, a hallmark of melanomas.

Surprisingly, melanocytes from PROTX1 -  or PROTX2 - null mice remained TPA - dependent, and disruption of PROTX2 accelerated cell death in the absence of this mitogen.
Thus, mechanisms other than the loss of PROTX0 or PROTX2 that activate PROTX1 may play an important role in melanomas.

The interaction between mutations in the tumor - suppressor genes PROTX1 and PROTX2 was studied in congenic mouse strains to minimize the influence of polymorphic modifiers.
The newly identified PROTX1 homolog PROTX2 mimics the transcriptional function of PROTX1.
It is shown here that growth factor - independent expression of the PROTX1 gene requires cd2 but not cd1, while activation of PROTX2 gene expression requires cd1 function in addition to that of cd2.
These data suggest that PROTX2 gene expression is controlled by two distinct negative signals, one of which also restricts expression of the PROTX1 gene.
It functions as a transcriptional activator as well as a repressor for a number of viral and cellular promoters transcribed by PROTX1 (PROTX1) and by RNA PROTX2.
In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of PROTX1 transcriptional inhibition by PROTX2.
Unlike PROTX1, there appear to be multiple transcripts for PROTX2 and their distribution appears to vary in different tissues and cell lines.
This study evaluated the influence of PROTX1 expression on a critical variable regulating BCG - tumor interaction, the tumor expression of PROTX2.
RESULTS: mRNAs for both the alpha5 and PROTX2 were increased an average of 9.4 fold and 125.7 fold respectively in the PROTX1 overexpressing transfectants relative to the parental 253J cells.
